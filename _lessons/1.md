Welcome! What you are about to learn is *one* way to spell modern English with runes. There are other ways, however I believe that this is the most authentic and useful for the English language in particular. 

This method of using runes for modern English was developed by [Rune Revival](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnRunes). Subscribe to that channel! All I aim to do here is offer an alternative method of learning how to use them. A method that works for me.

In learning this system, you will use only [Anglo-Saxon runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes) with as little changes as possible from the original usage. Where there are changes, there is an order of consideration:

1. The historical record of Anglo Saxon rune usage
2. The era of latin letter usage in England that existed simultaneously with rune usage
3. Rune usage from other areas that pre-dates the Anglo Saxon runes
4. Modern latin letter usage

The majority of rune usage in this system is taken from #1. We pick up today right where they left off. But in some cases, English today is different from English back then. In these situations, we need to make adjustments and take ideas from #2, #3, and #4.

## Getting used to the look

Let’s look closer at the runes themselves to give you an idea of what we’re dealing with:

<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳᚷᚹᚻᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛁᛄᛇᛈᛉᛋᛏᛒᛖ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛗᛚᛝᛟᛞᚪᚫᛠᚣᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚸᛢᛥᛡᛤ</div>

Thematically, you can notice some common patterns among how they look. Look below and notice the lines and shapes of them. Don’t pay attention or think about the sounds they make yet.

<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚫᚪᚩ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᛠᛏᛚᚹᚱᛒ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᚷᛡᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛄᚸᛤ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚳᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛞᛗ</div>

Are you feeling comfy? Good. Let's go.

Welcome!

The rune for <strong>L</strong> is <mark>ᛚ</mark>.

The rune for <strong>i</strong> is <mark>ᛁ</mark>.

The rune for <strong>P</strong> is <mark>ᛈ</mark>.

    <summary>ᛈᛁᛚᛚ</summary>
    <p>pill</p>
</details>

The rune for <strong>K</strong> is <mark>ᛣ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᛁᛚᛚ</summary>
    <p>kill</p>
</details>

The rune for <strong>T</strong> is <mark>ᛏ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᛁᛚᛚ</summary>
    <p>till</p>
</details>

Now, at this point, you may be thinking "Wow, this runic spelling is just like latin spelling" because it has the double L. Not quite!

It's actually *better* than the latin spelling because it is *consistent*. 

It seems like latin spelling always doubles the consonant to make a shorter vowel sound, but that is not the case. In runic spelling however, this rule is consistently applied.

    <summary>ᛚᛁᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>lip</p>
</details>

So what happens if we *don't* double the consonants in runic spelling?

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛁᛚ</summary>
    <p>peel</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᛁᛚ</summary>
    <p>keel</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᛁᛚ</summary>
    <p>teal</p>
</details>

What you are realizing now is that the <strong>ᛁ</strong> rune has two sounds. The "i" in "if" as well as the long "ee" sound in "sleep".

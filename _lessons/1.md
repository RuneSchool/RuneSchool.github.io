Welcome! 

Runes are cool. [English used to use them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes). They switched to Latin letters and everything went downhill from there.

Would it be better to return to runes? Yes, actually.

Is it possible? Again, yes.

The runic system taught in this course, devised by [Rune Revival](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnRunes), is just *one* way to write modern English with runes. 

All systems for writing English with runes must introduce certain changes because the English language itself has changed. 

The runic system in this course is so good because it is respectful and authentic to the history of the English language itself. But most importantly, it *works*. It even works with all the different English accents.

If you know the English language, you can do this course. Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BThW4fxAwN) if you have questions, feedback, or want to practice!

## Getting used to the look

Let’s look closer at the runes themselves to give you an idea of what we’re dealing with:

<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳᚷᚹᚻᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛁᛄᛇᛈᛉᛋᛏᛒᛖ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛗᛚᛝᛟᛞᚪᚫᛠᚣᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚸᛢᛥᛡᛤ</div>

Thematically, you can notice some common patterns among how they look. Look below and notice the lines and shapes of them. Don’t pay attention or think about the sounds they make yet.

<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚫᚪᚩ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᛠᛏᛚᚹᚱᛒ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᚷᛡᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛄᚸᛤ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚳᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛞᛗᛖ</div>

Are you feeling comfy? Good. Let's go.

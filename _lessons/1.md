Welcome! What you are about to learn is *one way* to spell modern English with runes. There are other ways, however I believe that this is the most authentic and useful for the English language in particular. 

This method of using runes for modern English was developed by [Rune Revival](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnRunes). Subscribe to that channel! 

You will use only [Anglo-Saxon runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes) with as little changes as possible from the original usage. Where there are changes, there is an order of consideration:

1. The historical record of Anglo Saxon rune usage
2. The era of latin letter usage in England that existed simultaneously with rune usage
3. More ancient rune usage from abroad
4. Modern latin letter usage

The majority of rune usage in this system is taken from #1. We pick up today right where they left off. But in some cases, English today is different from English back then. In these situations, we need to travel further down and take ideas from #2, #3, and #4.

## Getting used to the look

Let’s look closer at the runes themselves to give you an idea of what we’re dealing with:

<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳᚷᚹᚻᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛁᛄᛇᛈᛉᛋᛏᛏᛒᛖ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛗᛚᛝᛟᛞᚪᚫᛠᚣᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚸᛢᛥᛡᛤ</div>

Thematically, you can notice some common patterns among how they look. These patterns don’t necessarily show correlation in sound, but sometimes they can. Please just look below and notice the lines and shapes of them. Don’t pay attention or think about the sounds they make yet.

<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚫᚪᚩ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛁᛠᛏᛚᚹᚱᛒ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛁᚷᛡᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛄᚸᛤ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚳᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛞᛗ</div>

The biggest change for the modern English speaker is that the runes are a single-height script. Now, this doesn't need to be the case in the future. Perhaps a future font will make the vowels (ᚫᛖᚢᛁᛄᛟᚣᚩᛠᛡ) short and make the consonants (ᛞᚻᛏᚾᛋᛚᚳᚱᚸᚠᛈᚷᛣᛒᛗᚹᚦᛉᛝᛇ) ascend or descend. But the fact is that today, all the fonts that you will use will be single-height. That is the normal way to see them.

There are people that say that single-height scripts are difficult to read, but I believe that this is just something that takes getting used to. Russian (Cyrillic), Chinese, and Korean (Hangeul) are all effectively single-height and people do just great with those scripts.

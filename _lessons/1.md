# The Problem at Hand

An alphabet is a tool for communucation. We write down the sounds of our speech, another person reads what we have written and can sound out what we have "said".

With alphabets, we can "speak" over far distances and into the future. There is no other tool that has had more impact on the world. 

Now, the original idea of an alphabet is simple; like a hammer. But today with English, the  way that we use the alphabet (how we spell) has become something complicated; like a large factory machine for which we have lost the instructions. 

> "Anyone who can only think of one way to spell a word obviously lacks imagination." ― Mark Twain

Anyone can learn to use a hammer. But learning to use a complicated machine takes time and effort that feels pointless. Why not just pick up a hammer? Are you trying to get a job done (communicate) or simply show off how smart you are? 

## Solutions?

So what is an English speaker to do? 

Fix our current Latin alphabet spelling? The amount of proposals to do so are endless. Ultimately, it would take a united effort of all English-speaking nations to enforce such a proposal. Even if that happened, would the people accept it? When you spell words a certain way your whole life, they are like childhood friends. A government requiring you to change your spelling later in life is like killing your old friends!

Make a new, logical alphabet? Now we're getting somewhere. Such a new alphabet, tailor-made for English, could exist alongside our traditional Latin alphabet as a helpful tool for more accurate and easy communication. A new spelling of a word wouldn't feel like killing an old friend, but rather like making a *new* friend! The problem is, if an alphabet can be created arbitrarily, it can be changed arbitrarily. Who is to decide which letter shape is better than another? A logical system could always be made *more* logical.

Adopt a foreign alphabet like Cyrillic or Greek? We would be in the same spot we are in with Latin. It's not made for English. And the fact that it lacks a proper tie to English history makes it, again, feel arbitrary.

So we need a solution that has:

1. Logical and consistent spelling that simplifies communication
2. Can co-exist with traditional Latin spelling
3. Design that is the product of history and not arbitrary 
4. Historical ties to the English language

The [Anglo-Saxon Futhorc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes) provides such a solution.

English used to use these runes. So the sounds and designs of the runes are not totally arbitrary. And yet, the runes are new to people today, freeing us to spell in a way that is connected with speech.

Is it really possible to return to using runes? Yes!

The runic system taught in this course, devised by [Rune Revival](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnRunes), is just *one* way to write modern English with runes. 

All systems for writing English with runes must introduce certain changes because the English language itself has changed since the last time we used runes. 

The runic system in this course is so good because it is respectful and authentic to the history of the English language itself. But most importantly, it *works*. It even works with all the different English accents.

If you know the English language, you can complete this brief course. It doesn't matter which English accent you have. I will specify major accent differences with flag emojis in this course: 🇺🇸 🇬🇧.

## Getting used to the look

Let’s look closer at the runes themselves to give you an idea of what we’re dealing with:

<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳᚷᚹᚻᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛁᛄᛇᛈᛉᛋᛏᛒᛖ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛗᛚᛝᛟᛞᚪᚫᛠᚣᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚸᛢᛥᛡᛤ</div>

Thematically, you can notice some common patterns among how they look. Look below and notice the lines and shapes of them. Don’t pay attention or think about the sounds they make yet.

<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚫᚪᚩ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᛏᛚᚹᚱᛒ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᛏᛇᛏᛠᛢ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᚷᛡᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛄᚸᛤ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚳᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛞᛗᛖ</div>

Are you feeling comfy? Good. Let's go.

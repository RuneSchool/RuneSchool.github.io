Welcome! The English language used to be written with what is called the [Anglo-Saxon futhorc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes). If you've ever wondered what English would be like if they never switched to Latin letters, this course will show you! Moreover, you will see that returning to English's runic roots *is possible today*.

The runic system in this course, devised by [Rune Revival](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnRunes), is just *one* way to write modern English with runes. All systems for writing English with runes must introduce certain changes because the English language itself has changed. What makes this system so strong is that it is extremely respectful and authentic to the history of the English language itself. But most importantly, it *works*.

You only need to know the English language to go through this brief course. You are not required to have any special knowledge of linguistics. Any terms used will include explanations or links for more information.

## Getting used to the look

Let’s look closer at the runes themselves to give you an idea of what we’re dealing with:

<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳᚷᚹᚻᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛁᛄᛇᛈᛉᛋᛏᛒᛖ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᛗᛚᛝᛟᛞᚪᚫᛠᚣᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2em;">ᚸᛢᛥᛡᛤ</div>

Thematically, you can notice some common patterns among how they look. Look below and notice the lines and shapes of them. Don’t pay attention or think about the sounds they make yet.

<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚫᚪᚩ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᛠᛏᛚᚹᚱᛒ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛁᚷᛡᚾ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛄᚸᛤ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᚳᛣ</div>
<div style="font-size:2.3em;">ᛞᛗ</div>

Are you feeling comfy? Good. Let's go.

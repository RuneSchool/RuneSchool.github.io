What is <mark>ᛤ</mark>?

It's a bit of a mystery. Some people think it's a mistake where someone meant to carve ᚸ but messed it up.

However, some rune users have started using it as a shorthand for ᛣᛣ. That is to say, it is a doubled ᛣ.

The rune for <strong>F</strong> is <mark>ᚠ</mark>.

This is the very first rune in the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. I think it is fitting that we end our journey on this one.

Interestingly, this rune is also how you make the <strong>V</strong> sound. This is because historically F and V were what we call an [allophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone). The two sounds were not meaningfully distinguished in native germanic words.

Now I know what you're thinking. "F and V are no longer treated as the same sound. They are distinct sounds now!"

That is true. Just stick with me on this. Go through these exercises and think about them.

Now in normal every day talk, the likelihood that you will be misunderstood because of this is small. So currently, I recommend just using ᚠ as-is for both the F and V sound.

But what is the *ideal* way to handle "v"? What is the way that should be used in books, non-casual text, etc?

## Bindrunes

The ideal way to indicate the V sound is to use what is called a bindrune. A bindrune is when you combine two runes together to form a single rune. 

The logic behind doing this is set by the Anglo-Saxon runic tradition before us.

ᚳ was originally the rune for two sounds "ch" and "k". Eventually, this rune was doubled to create a separate rune just for the "k" sound. That is how we got ᛣ (notice how it looks like ᚳ+ᚳ).

Similarly, since ᚠ is used for both the F and V sounds, we would double it to create a rune just for the "v" sound which looks like the below:

![Catrinity font V](/assets/images/Catrinity-V.png)

Personally, I like to write this letter to look more like a traditional arrow.

And similar to all of the other sounds that are never doubled (ᛝ,ᛋᚳ,ᛉᚳ,ᛇ,ᛢ,ᛥ), this new bindrune would never be doubled either.

## Why use Bindrunes?

Bindrunes would be useful for more than just V however. Here are some other ways that we can leverage them.

### Holding accents together

If you remember back to [lesson 7](/lessons/7), we gave many examples where the British accent differs from the American. Particularly, they don't pronounce the R in many words. This is called a non-rhotic accent (American accent is called "rhotic" because it pronounces the R).

There is a future possibility that both rhotic and non-rhotic accents can both write in the same way. This would be achieved with **bindrunes**.

If we use bindrunes for ᚪᚱ, ᚩᚱ, and ᛖᚱ, then both rhotic and non-rhotic speakers could be satisfied. British speakers would read them as "ah", "oh", and "eh", while American speakers would read them as "ar", "or", and "er".

![Catrinity font AR bindrune](/assets/images/Catrinity-AR.png)
![Catrinity font OR bindrune](/assets/images/Catrinity-OR.png)
![Catrinity font ER bindrune](/assets/images/Catrinity-ER.png)

This could also be done with some other common combination runes such as ᚩᚢ, ᛖᛡ, ᚪᛡ, and ᚩᛡ. 

The end result of using bindrunes for all of these is that each individual English accent could see the one unique rune and think of them as "that sound" instead of "this rune plus that rune". Psychologically, it could be more satisfying and unifying for the whole English world.

Here is an example text in the BabelStone Runic font which supports bindrunes:

<pre style="font-size:16px;font-family:BabelStoneRunic;">
ᚦᛟ᛫​ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ᛫​ᛈᛖᛡᚷ᛫​ᚸᚩᚢᛋᛏ᛫​ᚠᛚᚪᛡᛉ᛫​ᚠᚩᚱ᛫​ᛈᚩᛡᚾᛏᛋ 👈 using no bindrunes

ᚦᛟ᛫​ᛋᛣᚹᛖ‍ᚱ᛫​ᛈᛖ‍ᛡᚷ᛫​ᚸᚩ‍ᚢᛋᛏ᛫​ᚠᛚᚪ‍ᛡᛉ᛫​ᚠᚩ‍ᚱ᛫​ᛈᚩ‍ᛡᚾᛏᛋ 👈 using bindrunes
</pre>

Here is the same text that uses bindrunes, rendered with the Noto Sans Runic font which does *not* support bindrunes. The text will simply render without the bindrunes and still be readable:

<pre style="font-size:20px;font-family:NotoSansRunic-Regular;">ᚦᛟ᛫​ᛋᛣᚹᛖ‍ᚱ᛫​ᛈᛖ‍ᛡᚷ᛫​ᚸᚩ‍ᚢᛋᛏ᛫​ᚠᛚᚪ‍ᛡᛉ᛫​ᚠᚩ‍ᚱ᛫​ᛈᚩ‍ᛡᚾᛏᛋ</pre>

### Double consonants

Remember how ᛤ is used as a way of doubling ᛣ? Bindrunes could also be used to create more doubled consonants.

![Catrinity font doubled R](/assets/images/Catrinity-RR.png)
![Catrinity font doubled M](/assets/images/Catrinity-MM.png)
![Catrinity font doubled B](/assets/images/Catrinity-BB.png)

Personally, I'm unsure of the usefulness of this outside of aesthetics. It may be a better idea to reserve bindrunes for representing unique phonemes, but I'm up in the air about it. Let me know what you think.

## How to type bindrunes

To write bindrunes by hand, all you need is creativity. Go ahead and have fun!

To *type* bindrunes today, you need two things:

1. A zero-width-joiner key on a keyboard
2. A font that will correctly render the bindrune

If you use the [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) app and [Rune Revival's keyboard](https://keyman.com/keyboards/runeboard) for it, you will have the "ZWJ" key. You press one rune, then "ZWJ", then the other rune.

Currently there are not many fonts that support bindrunes, however; so that is why you won't often see it work. 

- [Babelstone Runic](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/Runic.html) supports most bindrunes 
- [Catrinity](https://catrinity-font.de/) supports some bindrunes

On this website, we are using Noto Sans Runic.

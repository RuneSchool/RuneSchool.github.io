The rune for <strong>L</strong> is <mark>ᛚ</mark>.

The rune for <strong>i</strong> is <mark>ᛁ</mark>.

The rune for <strong>P</strong> is <mark>ᛈ</mark>.

Read the runic text below. Think about what it might spell. Then click or tap on the text to see if you were correct!

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛁᛚᛚ</summary>
    <p>pill</p>
</details>

The rune for <strong>K</strong> is <mark>ᛣ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᛁᛚᛚ</summary>
    <p>kill</p>
</details>

The rune for <strong>T</strong> is <mark>ᛏ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᛁᛚᛚ</summary>
    <p>till</p>
</details>

Now, at this point, you may be thinking "Wow, this runic spelling is just like latin spelling" because it has the double L. Not quite!

It's actually *better* than the latin spelling because it is *consistent*. 

It seems like latin spelling always doubles the consonant to make a shorter vowel sound, but that is not the case. In runic spelling however, this rule is consistently applied.

    <summary>ᛚᛁᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>lip</p>
</details>

So what happens if we *don't* double the consonants in runic spelling?

    <p>peel</p>

    <summary>ᛣᛁᛚ</summary>
    <p>keel</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᛁᛚ</summary>
    <p>teal</p>
</details>

What you are realizing now is that the <strong>ᛁ</strong> rune has two sounds. The "i" in "if" as well as the long "ee" sound in "sleep".

These two sounds are often interchanged in interesting ways in English. Think of how some people say "creek" and some say "crick".

The rune for <strong>W</strong> is <mark>ᚹ</mark>.

Notice that this rune looks like a P, but it is not. Maybe think of a flag **w**aving in the air ᚹ.

That last one was interesting, right? Since we are spelling according to sound, we will have more synonyms (words that sound the same, but mean different things) *look* the same. Puns are about to get a lot more fun.

The rune for <strong>S</strong> is <mark>ᛋ</mark>.

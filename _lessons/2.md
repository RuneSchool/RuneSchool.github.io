    <p>kit</p>

The rune for a <strong>y</strong> sound is <mark>ᛄ</mark>.

When you combine the i sound in "kit" with a y sound, it makes "ee".

The rune combination for a fl<strong>ee</strong>ce sound is <mark>ᛁᛄ</mark>.

    <p>teal</p>
</details>

You may notice that when you say a word like "teal", it almost sounds like "tee-yuhl". This is because there is a subtle "y" sounds in the long ee sound. We notice the y sound more strongly before an L.

The rune for <strong>R</strong> is... <mark>ᚱ</mark>.

The two vowel sounds that we've learned so far ("kit" and "fleece") are often interchanged in interesting ways in English. Think of how some people say "creek" and some say "crick".

    <p>peak</p>
</details>

If we want the "kit" sound to have an ᚱ at the end like in the word "near", we need to use two ᛁ runes together. 

Why ᛁᛁ? Because if we only used one, it would be a different phoneme that some English dialects still have, but most do not.

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛁᛁᚱ</summary>
    <p>pier</p>
</details>

You may notice that you have a pause in between the two ᛁᛁ runes like "pee-er". And that is why we use the two runes instead of the one. It's a lengthened sound.

These principles and patterns that you're learning will apply in many other areas. And there will be some shortcuts later on as well.

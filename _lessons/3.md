The rune for <strong>W</strong> is <mark>ᚹ</mark>.

Notice that this rune looks like a P, but it is not. Maybe think of a flag **w**aving in the air ᚹ.

    <p>week / weak</p>
</details>

That last one was interesting, right? Since we are spelling according to sound, we will have more homophones (words that sound the same, but mean different things) *look* the same. Puns are about to get a lot more fun.

The rune for the vowel in dr<strong>e</strong>ss is <mark>ᛖ</mark>.

    <p>wreck</p>

Remember the y rune that turned "i" into "ee"? We can also attach that on the end of this one! Try to guess what sound it will make:

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᛖᛄ</summary>
    <p>lay</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚱᛖᛄ</summary>
    <p>tray / Trey</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᛖᛄᛏ</summary>
    <p>wait</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛖᛄᛚ</summary>
    <p>pale / pail</p>
</details>

Did that last one sound like "pay-ul"? Just like "teal" from last lesson, when an L sound comes after a Y sound we sometimes pronounce a little "uh" in between.

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᛖᛄᛚ</summary>
    <p>tale / tail</p>
</details>

The rune for the y sound at the end of happ<strong>y</strong> is <mark>ᛡ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᛁᛏᛡ</summary>
    <p>kitty</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛁᛣᛡ</summary>
    <p>picky</p>
</details>

Why not just use "ᛁᛄ" or "ᛁ"? Well, this "happY" sound could be either of those, depending on your accent. So this rune represents "whichever sound you make for that". 

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᛁᛄᛣᛡ</summary>
    <p>leaky</p>
</details>

The rune for <strong>M</strong> is <mark>ᛗ</mark>.

    <summary>ᛗᛖᛄᛚ</summary>
    <p>male / mail</p>
</details>

When an ᚱ comes after ᛖ, it can have two different sounds. It could sound like the word "merry" or the name "Mary". Some accents don't distinguish between these two and they both sound like "Mary"! But since some accents *do* distinguish them, we must account for it.

<details>
    <summary>ᛗᛖᚱᛡ</summary>
    <p>merry</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛗᛖᛖᚱᛡ</summary>
    <p>Mary</p>
</details>

It's sort of like the situation with ᛁᛁᚱ, remember? 

If you're not sure which spelling to use, just use ᛖᛖᚱ. But there are some hints.

ᛖᚱ is spelled in Latin letters with "-er-" or "-err-".

ᛖᛖᚱ is usually spelled in Latin letters with "-ar-", "-air-", or "-ear-"

The rune for the vowel in <strong>aw</strong>e is <mark>ᚩ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚩᛣ</summary>
    <p>walk</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚩᛣ</summary>
    <p>talk</p>
</details>

Now what do you think happens if you double the consonant after this vowel?

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᚩᛣᛣ</summary>
    <p>sock</p>
</details>

It becomes the vowel in the [LOT lexical set](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/4-lot-lexical-set/). Note that for a number of English speakers, the vowels in the this lexical set will shift into other phonemes quite regularly. You can read that article for more info. Don't be dismayed if you can't figure out how "lot" is pronounced. If you're an American, you may almost never double the consonant after ᚩ. That is okay!

    <p>tick tock</p>

The rune for the vowel in sp<strong>a</strong> is <mark>ᚪ</mark>.

Now, if you are an American, you may pronounce "tock" and "sock" more with this "spa" sound. Go ahead and spell it like ᛏᚪᛣ or ᛋᚪᛣ! The nice thing is that ᚩ and ᚪ look pretty similar to each other anyway :)

If you're an American, what does this say?

    <summary>ᛈᚩᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>pop</p>
</details>

Now, what happens if we double the consonant after ᚪ?

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚩᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>putt</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚩᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>pup</p>
</details>

Now you might be wondering, "what do these two sounds have in common with each other? why use the same rune for both?" And the answer is, a lot! Let me show you:

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚩᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>what</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚩᛈᛈ??</summary>
    <p>wat??</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚩᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>klutz</p>

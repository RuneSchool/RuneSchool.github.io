The rune for <strong>M</strong> is <mark>ᛗ</mark>.

The rune for the vowel in <strong>aw</strong>e is <mark>ᚩ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚩᛣ</summary>
    <p>walk</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚩᛣ</summary>
    <p>talk</p>
</details>

Now what do you think happens if you double the consonant after this vowel?

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᚩᛣᛣ</summary>
    <p>sock</p>
</details>

It becomes the vowel in the [LOT lexical set](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/4-lot-lexical-set/). A lexical set is a group of words that all use the same phoneme. "Dog" and "walk" are in the same lexical set for example.

Note that for a number of English speakers, the vowels in the this LOT lexical set will vary in pronunciation. You can read that article for more info. Don't be dismayed if you can't figure out how "lot" is pronounced.

    <p>slop</p>

The rune for the vowel in sp<strong>a</strong> is <mark>ᚪ</mark>.

Now, if you are an American, you may pronounce "tock", "sock", and "slop" more with this "spa" phoneme. Go ahead and spell it like ᛏᚪᛣ, ᛋᚪᛣ, and ᛋᛚᚪᛈ! The nice thing is that ᚩ and ᚪ look pretty similar to each other anyway :)

I like to spell the LOT words with ᚩ followed by a double consonant even though I am an American, because I think that is a good compromise for an international way to spell and most often reflects the historical latin spelling anyway. But I will also try to specify major accent differences with flag emojis too: 🇺🇸 🇬🇧

We always want to spell names as accurately as possible regardless of wanting to be international, however. If you're an American "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚪᛗ. If you're a British "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚩᛗᛗ.

Now, what happens if we double the consonant after ᚪ?

    <p>tuck</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᚪᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>cup</p>
</details>

You might be wondering, "what do these two sounds have in common with each other? why use the same rune for both?" Let me show you with a couple of examples.

Americans say "what" like ᚹᚪᛏᛏ (wut). This is often exhaggerated in a silly way like ᚹᚪᛏ (wat).

British people say ᛗᚪᛗᛗ (mum) while Americans say ᛗᚪᛗ (mahm).

These two examples show that in our minds, we do think of these two sounds as being somewhat related. And that is often expressed in our colloquialisms and slang.

Here is a hard one. Take your time!

The rune for the vowel in c<strong>a</strong>t is <mark>ᚫ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᚫᛏ</summary>
    <p>sat</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚫᛣ</summary>
    <p>whack</p>
</details>

This sound is quite easy to understand.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛚᚫᛈ᛫ᛁᛏᛏ</summary>
    <p>slap it</p>
</details>

What happens when we double the consonant after ᚫ? Nothing! Who knows, maybe in the future, English speakers will want to make [some distinction](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bad-lad_split) important, but as of now, there's no reason to double consonants after ᚫ.

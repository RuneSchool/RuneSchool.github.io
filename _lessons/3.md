Now what do you think happens if you double the consonant after this vowel?

It becomes the vowel in the [LOT lexical set](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/4-lot-lexical-set/). A *lexical set* is a group of words that all use the same phoneme (sound). "Dog" and "walk" are in the same lexical set for example.

Sometimes this LOT sound is referred to as "short o".

If you're an American, you will probably pronounce "sock" and "lot" more like "sahk" and "laht".

The rune for the vowel in sp<strong>a</strong> is <mark>ᚪ</mark>.

For many Americans, the LOT lexical set effectively does not exist. Instead of ᚩ followed by two consonants, they will write either ᚩ followed by *one* consonant, or just ᚪ.

Here are some examples of how pronunciations can differ using the International Phonetic Alphabet and Runes.

| Word in LOT lexical set | British | American |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lot | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| sock | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| watch | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| lost | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɔː/ (ᚩ + one consonant) |
| dog | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɔː/ (ᚩ + one consonant) |
| on | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɔː/ (ᚩ + one consonant) |

The nice thing is that these spelling differences don't look a great deal different from each other when just scanning the text.

I like to spell the LOT words with ᚩ followed by a double consonant even though I am an American, because I think that is a good compromise for an international way to spell and most often reflects the historical latin spelling anyway. But I will also specify major accent differences with flag emojis in this course: 🇺🇸 🇬🇧

We always want to spell names as accurately as possible regardless of wanting to be international, however. If you're an American "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚪᛗ. If you're a British "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚩᛗᛗ.

Now, what happens if we double the consonant after ᚪ?

You might be wondering, "what do these two sounds have in common with each other? why use the same rune for both?" Let me show you with a couple of examples.

Americans say "what" like ᚹᚪᛏᛏ (wut). This is often exhaggerated in a silly way like ᚹᚪᛏ (wat).

British people say ᛗᚪᛗᛗ (mum) while Americans say ᛗᚪᛗ (mahm).

These two examples show that in our minds, we do think of these two sounds as being somewhat related. And that is often expressed in our colloquialisms and slang.

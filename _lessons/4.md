So far, you've learned two vowel runes. <mark>ᛁ</mark> and <mark>ᛖ</mark>. Each one can make additional phonemes by following predictable patterns.

The rune for <strong>S</strong> is <mark>ᛋ</mark>.

You see how to use ᛟᚱ, but what happens when you double ᛟ like in ᛁᛁ or ᛖᛖ?

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᛟᛟᚱᛣ</summary>
    <p>work</p>
</details>

ᛟᛟᚱ is the sound in the word "nurse". If you pronounce comm<strong>a</strong> and lett<strong>er</strong> more open like in the word "spa", think of ᛟᛟ as closing that sound a bit more (a similar effect that ᛁᛁ and ᛖᛖ has).

This "NURSE" sound in English comes from multiple different paths. You'll see it spelled -ur-, -ir-, -er-, etc. because these words used to be pronounced more like those spellings. 

| Latin | Old English pronunciations | Modern English pronunciations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first | ᛁᚱ | ᛟᛟᚱ |
| burn | ᚢᚱ* | ᛟᛟᚱ |
| herb | ᛖᚱ | ᛟᛟᚱ |

**more on ᚢ in lesson 7*

If you wish to spell these words according to their old phonemes, you are free to do that. The system taught in this school allows for that. However, we will continue spelling this "NURSE" phoneme according to modern pronunciations for the remainder of this course.

In some accents, ᛟᚱ and ᛟᛟᚱ sound the same. Just keep in mind that "lettER" is usually the -er suffix. 

The rune for <strong>N</strong> is <mark>ᚾ</mark>.

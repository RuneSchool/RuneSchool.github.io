So far, you've learned two vowel runes. <mark>ᛁ</mark> and <mark>ᛖ</mark>. Each one can make additional phonemes by following similar patterns.

ᛚᛈᛁᛣᛏᛄᚱᚹᚹᛖᛡᛗ

The rune for the vowel in sp<strong>a</strong>, t<strong>a</strong>co, and f<strong>a</strong>ther is <mark>ᚪ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪ ᛏᚪ</summary>
    <p>ta ta</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᚪᚱ</summary>
    <p>car</p>
</details>

Remember the y rune that turned "i" into "ee"? We can also attach that on the end of this one! Try to guess what sound it will make:

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᚪᛄ</summary>
    <p>lie</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚱᚪᛄ</summary>
    <p>try</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᚪᛄᚱ</summary>
    <p>liar / lyre</p>
</details>

Did that last one sound like "lie-ur"? That's because when a ᚱ comes after a ᛄ, we sometimes pronounce a little "uh" in between. ᚱ and ᛚ behave similarly like that (remember "teal"?).

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚪᛄᛏ</summary>
    <p>white</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᛄᛈ</summary>
    <p>type</p>
</details>

Now what do you get when ᚹ comes after ᚪ?

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚪᚹ</summary>
    <p>wow</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᚹ</summary>
    <p>tao / tau</p>
</details>

The rune for the vowel in th<strong>ough</strong>t is <mark>ᚩ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚩᛣ</summary>
    <p>walk</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚩᛣ</summary>
    <p>talk</p>
</details>

Now what do you think happens if you double the consonant after this vowel?

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᚩᛣᛣ</summary>
    <p>sock</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᚩᛏᛏ</summary>
    <p>lot</p>
</details>

It becomes the vowel in the [LOT lexical set](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/4-lot-lexical-set/). A *lexical set* is a group of words that all use the same phoneme (sound). "Law" and "walk" are in the same lexical set for example.

Sometimes this LOT sound is referred to as "short o".

If you're an American, you will probably pronounce "sock" and "lot" more like "sahk" and "laht".

The rune for the vowel in sp<strong>a</strong>, t<strong>a</strong>co, and f<strong>a</strong>ther is <mark>ᚪ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛈᚪ</summary>
    <p>spa</p>
</details>

For many Americans, the LOT lexical set effectively does not exist. Instead of ᚩ followed by two consonants, they will write either ᚩ followed by *one* consonant, or just ᚪ.

Here are some examples of how pronunciations can differ using the International Phonetic Alphabet and Runes.

| Word | British | American |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lot | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| sock | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| watch | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| lost | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɔː/ (ᚩ + one consonant) |
| dog | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɔː/ (ᚩ + one consonant) |
| on | /ɒ/ (ᚩ + double consonant) | /ɔː/ (ᚩ + one consonant) |

</details>

<details>
    <summary>🇬🇧 ᛚᚩᛋᛋᛏ<br>🇺🇸 ᛚᚩᛋᛏ</summary>
    <p>lost</p>
</details>

The nice thing is that these spelling differences don't look a great deal different from each other when just scanning the text. This is because ᚩ and ᚪ look quite related already. As you can now see, that is a feature!

Now, what happens if we double the consonant after ᚪ?

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚪᛏᛏ</summary>
    <p>putt</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚪᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>pup</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᛣᛣ</summary>
    <p>tuck</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᚪᛈᛈ</summary>
    <p>cup</p>
</details>

You might be wondering, "what do these two sounds have in common with each other? why use the same rune for both?" Let me show you with a couple of examples.

Americans say "what" like ᚹᚪᛏᛏ (wut). This is often exhaggerated in a silly way like ᚹᚪᛏ (wat).

British people say ᛗᚪᛗᛗ (mum) while Americans say ᛗᚪᛗ (mahm).

These two examples show that in our minds, we do think of these two sounds as being somewhat related. And that is often expressed in our colloquialisms and slang.

The rune for <strong>N</strong> is <mark>ᚾ</mark>.

The rune for the vowel in c<strong>a</strong>t is <mark>ᚫ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚾᛁᛣᛣᚾᚫᛣ</summary>
    <p>nicknack</p>

With the runes for M/N/L (ᛗ/ᚾ/ᛚ), we can sometimes just place them after consonants. These are called [syllabic consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_and_vowel_reduction_in_English#Syllabic_consonants).

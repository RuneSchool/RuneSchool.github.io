ᛚᛈᛁᛣᛏᛄᚱᚹᛖᛡᛗᛟᛋᛉᚾ

The rune for the vowel in sp<strong>a</strong>, t<strong>a</strong>co, and f<strong>a</strong>ther is <mark>ᚪ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪ ᛏᚪ</summary>
    <p>ta ta</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᚪᚱ</summary>
    <p>car</p>
</details>

Remember the y rune that turned "i" into "ee"? We can also attach that on the end of this one! Try to guess what sound it will make:

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᚪᛄ</summary>
    <p>lie</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚱᚪᛄ</summary>
    <p>try</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᚪᛄᚱ</summary>
    <p>liar / lyre</p>
</details>

Did that last one sound like "lie-ur"? That's because when a ᚱ comes after a ᛄ, we sometimes pronounce a little "uh" in between. ᚱ and ᛚ behave similarly like that (remember "teal"?).

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚪᛄᛏ</summary>
    <p>white</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᛄᛈ</summary>
    <p>type</p>
</details>

Now what do you get when ᚹ comes after ᚪ?

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚪᚹ</summary>
    <p>wow</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᚹ</summary>
    <p>tao / tau</p>
</details>

The rune for <strong>N</strong> is <mark>ᚾ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛁᚾ</summary>
    <p>pin</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚾᛁᛄᛚ</summary>
    <p>kneel</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᛄᛚ</summary>
    <p>Nile</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᚹᚾ</summary>
    <p>town</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᚹᛚ</summary>
    <p>towel</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛏᚪᚹᚱ</summary>
    <p>tower</p>
</details>





<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛈᚪ</summary>
    <p>spa</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛏᚪᚱᛏ</summary>
    <p>start</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛏᚪᛄᛚ</summary>
    <p>style</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᚪᚹᚱ</summary>
    <p>sour</p>
</details>

You're doing great!

Another great lexical set is [MOUTH](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/16-mouth-lexical-set/). 

However you pronounce the sound in M<strong>OU</strong>TH, the rune for that is <mark>ᚣ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚻᚣᛚ</summary>
    <p>howl</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚣᛏ</summary>
    <p>out</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚾᚣ</summary>
    <p>now</p>
</details>

In many fonts, you will see that ᚢ and ᚣ are related. Some english words even show this relation very clearly. How do you pronounce "route"? With ᚢ or with ᚣ?

For this next rune, we need to go on a little digression.

A *lexical set* is a group of words that all use the same vowel sound. "Pick" and "bill" are in the same lexical set, for example.

The rune for the vowel in L<strong>O</strong>T is <mark>ᚩ</mark>.

How do you pronounce those words? 

The pronunciation of the [LOT lexical set](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/4-lot-lexical-set/) varies depending on your accent.

If you're an American, some words in the LOT set get pushed to "ah", while others get pushed to "aw". For example, "sock" often becomes "sahk" while "dog" becomes "dawg".

The way we make the vowel sound in th<strong>ough</strong>t is <mark>ᚩᚩ</mark>.

From here on out, I will begin showing two different ways of spelling depending on British or American accents. The idea is to help you recognize your own accent and how that relates to others.

    <p>clock</p>

<details>
    <summary>🇬🇧 ᛚᚩᛋᛏ<br>🇺🇸 ᛚᚩᚩᛋᛏ</summary>
    <p>lost</p>
</details>

Here are some examples of how pronunciations can differ using the International Phonetic Alphabet and Runes.

| Word | British | American |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lot | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| sock | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| watch | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɑ/ (ᚪ) |
| lost | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɔː/ (ᚩᚩ) |
| dog | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɔː/ (ᚩᚩ) |
| on | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɔː/ (ᚩᚩ) |

For many Americans, words in the LOT lexical set will fluctuate wildly between ᚪ or ᚩᚩ. For example, "jog" could be pronounced by the same person like "jahg" or "jawg". For this reason, it would benefit Americans to recognize which words are part of this LOT lexical set and use ᚩ in most cases.

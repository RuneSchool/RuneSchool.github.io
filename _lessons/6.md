For this next rune, we need to go on a little digression.

A *lexical set* is a group of words that all use the same vowel sound. "Pick" and "bill" are in the same lexical set, for example.

The rune for the vowel in L<strong>O</strong>T is <mark>ᚩ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛒᚩᛏ</summary>
    <p>bot</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛏᚩᛈ</summary>
    <p>stop</p>
</details>

How do you pronounce those words? 

The pronunciation of the [LOT lexical set](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/4-lot-lexical-set/) varies depending on your accent.

If you're an American, some words in the LOT set get pushed to "ah", while others get pushed to "aw". For example, "sock" often becomes "sahk" while "dog" becomes "dawg".

The way we make the vowel sound in th<strong>ough</strong>t is <mark>ᚩᚩ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛒᚩᚩᛚ</summary>
    <p>ball</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᚩᚩᛏ</summary>
    <p>caught</p>
</details>

From here on out, I will begin showing two different ways of spelling depending on British or American accents. The idea is to help you recognize your own accent and how that relates to others. 

<details>
    <summary>🇬🇧 ᛣᛚᚩᛣ<br>🇺🇸 ᛣᛚᚫᚫᛣ</summary>
    <p>clock</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>🇬🇧 ᛚᚩᛋᛏ<br>🇺🇸 ᛚᚩᚩᛋᛏ</summary>
    <p>lost</p>
</details>

Here are some examples of how pronunciations can differ using the International Phonetic Alphabet and Runes.

| Word | British | American |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lot | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɑ/ (ᚫᚫ) |
| sock | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɑ/ (ᚫᚫ) |
| watch | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɑ/ (ᚫᚫ) |
| lost | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɔː/ (ᚩᚩ) |
| dog | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɔː/ (ᚩᚩ) |
| on | /ɒ/ (ᚩ) | /ɔː/ (ᚩᚩ) |

For many Americans, words in the LOT lexical set will fluctuate wildly between ᚫᚫ or ᚩᚩ. For example, "jog" could be pronounced by the same person like "jahg" or "jawg". For this reason, it would benefit Americans to recognize which words are part of this LOT lexical set and use ᚩ in most cases.

    <summary>ᛏᚩᛡ</summary>

If you don't know if a sound is ᛁ or ᛁᛡ, remember that you can use ᛄ for a catch-all "i" sound.

The rune combination for the vowel sound in S<strong>OU</strong>L is <mark>ᚩᚹ</mark>.

    <p>boat</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛉᚩᚹᚾ</summary>
    <p>zone</p>
</details>

You might notice that your pronunciation of "goal" is different from "boat". These are indeed different sounds for many people, but the important thing is that they are not *meaningfully* different. If you pronounce "boat" with the exact same vowel sound as "goal", no one will be confused.

In cases where you want to be more exact, you can use the combination of "ᛟᚹ" for the sound in "over", "open", "pope", etc. You might want to do this with someone's name for example.

In every other case, we suggest you just use ᚩᚹ for both sounds.

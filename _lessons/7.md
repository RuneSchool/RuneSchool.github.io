The rune for the vowel sound in <strong>A</strong>GO, COMM<strong>A</strong>, and LETT<strong>E</strong>R is <mark>ᛟ</mark>.

This is called a "schwa". It's sort of a "whatever" vowel. It occurs a lot in English!

This rune in more ancient forms took on the sound of "O". And it looks like a Latin "O" so that kind of makes sense, right? But in the Anglo-Saxon runes, it had a sound that we don't have anymore. A somewhat close sound is our modern "schwa" vowel.

For a good memory tactic, just think of how young people jokingly mispronounce "girl" as "gorl" or "turtle" as "tortle". These silly mispronunciations show that these sounds are linked in our minds somewhat. Also, take a look at this word that looks almost identical to its latin equivalent!

So that is an example of a brief ᛁ sound before an ᚱ, but what about the long ᛁ sound before an ᚱ?

The rune for the vowel sound in N<strong>EA</strong>R is <mark>ᛠ</mark>.

In this runic system, you will never see just ᛁᚱ. It will always be either ᛁᚱᚱ or ᛠᚱ.

Take your time with these. Sound them out slowly.

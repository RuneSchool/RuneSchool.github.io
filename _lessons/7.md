The "u" sound in English has a [long and sordid history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_English_close_back_vowels), but to make a long story short, the sound in "foot" and the sound in "strut" are cousins. For this reason, the two runes for these sounds look similar.

The rune for the vowel sound in f<strong>oo</strong>t is <mark>ᚣ</mark>.

Putting at ᚱ after this rune is a bit tricky. Many accents merge this phoneme into others. So don't worry if these spellings are hard for you to figure out.

This "strut" sound is more *open* than the sound in "foot". And notice that ᚢ looks more visually open than ᚣ.

If you pronounce "foot" and "strut" in the same way, don't worry. The visual similarity between the two should make it easier to read for others if you switch these runes around.

The rune combination for the vowel sound in g<strong>oo</strong>se is <mark>ᚣᚹ</mark>.

Notice again that when an L sound comes after a W or Y sound, there is some "commA" sound that is often inserted. Not always, but you might hear it. It's normal.

What happens when you put an ᚱ after ᚢ? 

<details>
    <summary>ᚹᚢᚱᛣ</summary>
    <p>work</p>

ᚢᚱ is the sound in the word "nurse".

</details>

In some accents, ᛟ(ᚱ) and ᚢ(ᚱ) sound the same. Just keep in mind that "commA" and "lettER" (ᛟ) are not stressed. If the sound is stressed, it is "strut" or "nurse" (ᚢ).

Think of ᛟ as quieter because it is visually tied shut at the bottom ᛟ. When you emphasize this sound, it visually unties and opens up ᚢ!

This "NURSE" sound in English comes from multiple different paths. You'll see it spelled -ur-, -ir-, -er-, etc. because these words used to be pronounced more like those spellings. 

| Latin | Old English pronunciations | Modern English pronunciations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first | ᛁᚱ | ᚢᚱ |
| burn | ᚢᚱ | ᚢᚱ |
| herb | ᛖᚱ | ᚢᚱ |

This system has essentially merged ᛖᚱ and ᛁᚱ *into* ᚢᚱ. 

If you wish to spell these words according to their old phonemes, you are free to do that. The system taught in this school allows for that. However, we will continue spelling this "NURSE" phoneme according to modern pronunciations for the remainder of this course.

## Side quest

We have up to now been assuming that all users would want to write the ᚱ rune even if they don't pronounce it. For sure, it is best to write the ᚱ if you want to be understood by all accents. But what if you're just writing casually to friends and want to show your own accent?

To have a bit of fun, read aloud the text of the accent that you do *not* have. See if you can figure out the word :)

The rune combination for the consonant sound in <strong>SH</strong>OE is <mark>ᛋᚳ</mark>.

When two consonants are combined like this to make a unique sound, they are never doubled after a vowel.

See how that is the short sound for ᚢ? In these cases, it's basically like "if you know, you know". It's not so bad for non-native speakers though. Because even native English speakers will jokingly pronounce that word as "mooshy".

The rune combination for the consonant sound in <strong>g</strong>enre, vi<strong>s</strong>ion, and bei<strong>g</strong>e  is <mark>ᛉᚳ</mark>.

The rune for the sound in -i<strong>ng</strong> is <mark>ᛝ</mark>.

Remember how ᛋᚳ is never doubled after a vowel? ᛝ is like that too.

And guess what, you treat this one just like ᛝ, ᛋᚳ, and ᛉᚳ (never double it!).

One cool aspect of this letter is that it has both "th" sounds, just like in English. So words like "breath" and "breathe" change simply just on usage. When you use "breath" like a verb, the pronunciation changes.

This lesson is all about shortcuts! First, let's start with the vowel shortcuts.

Up to now, you've been writing the "ee" sound like ᛁᛡ. 

Another way to write the <strong>ᛁᛡ</strong> sound is with the rune <mark>ᛇ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛁᛡᛋ -> ᛈᛇᛋ</summary>
    <p>peace</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛁᛡᛉᛄ᛫​ᛈᛁᛡᛉᛄ -> ᛇᛉᛄ᛫​ᛈᛇᛉᛄ</summary>
    <p>easy peasy</p>
</details>

Imagine that you combined ᛁ and ᛡ together. You take the two little sticks from the center part ᛡ and attach them on the ends of ᛁ to get ᛇ.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛚᛁᛡᛉ -> ᛋᛚᛇᛉ</summary>
    <p>sleaze</p>
</details>

The rune for the consonant sound in <strong>H</strong>UMANE and lo<strong>ch</strong> is *also* <mark>ᛇ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚻᛡᚣᚹᛋᛏᚾ -> ᛇᚣᚹᛋᛏᚾ</summary>
    <p>Houston</p>
</details>

This is also how you pronounce the famous composer's name most accurately.

<details>
    <summary>ᛒᚪᛣ -> ᛒᚪᛇ</summary>
    <p>Bach</p>
</details>

Another way to write the <strong>ᛁᛁ</strong> sound is with the rune <mark>ᛠ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚾᛁᛁᚱ -> ᚾᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>near</p>
</details>

Imagine if you combined ᛁ and ᛁ together. You just lay one on top of the other and boom.

<details>
    <summary>ᛁᛁᚱ -> ᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>ear</p>
</details>

One thing I didn't mention before about this phoneme is that it is "varisyllabic". This means that in some contexts it can be 1 syllable while in others it can be 2.

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᛁᛁ -> ᛚᛠ</summary>
    <p>Leah</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᛟᚱᛁᛁ -> ᛣᛟᚱᛠ</summary>
    <p>Korea</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚻᛁᛁᚱ -> ᚻᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>here / hear</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚱᛁᛁᛚ -> ᚱᛠᛚ</summary>
    <p>real</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛁᚾᛋᛁᛁᚱ -> ᛋᛁᚾᛋᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>sincere</p>
</details>

Take your time with these. Sound them out slowly.

<details>
    <summary>ᚫᛡᛞᛠᛚᚫᛡᛉ</summary>
    <p>idealize</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛒᚱᛁᚸᛟᛞᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>brigadier</p>
</details>

Another way to write the <strong>ᚫᚫ</strong> sound is with the rune <mark>ᚪ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛏᚫᚫᚱᛏ -> ᛋᛏᚪᚱᛏ</summary>
    <p>start</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛈᚫᚫ -> ᛋᛈᚪ</summary>
    <p>spa</p>
</details>

Isn't that nice?! Now let's move on to shortcuts for some consonant combinations!

The rune for the sound in PA<strong>ST</strong> and <strong>ST</strong>OP is <mark>ᛥ</mark>.

It is a shortcut for writing ᛋᛏ.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛏᚪᚱᛏ -> ᛥᚪᚱᛏ</summary>
    <p>start</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚩᚹᛋᛏ -> ᛈᚩᚹᛥ</summary>
    <p>post</p>
</details>

You would not use this rune if you have the S and T sounds split across two syllables like "pastime".

The rune for the sound in <strong>QU</strong>ICK and <strong>QU</strong>EEN is <mark>ᛢ</mark>.

It is a shortcut for ᚳᚹ.

<details>
    <summary>ᚳᚹᛇᚾ᛫​ᛒᛁᛡ -> ᛢᛇᚾ᛫​ᛒᛇ</summary>
    <p>queen bee</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚳᚹᛁᛣᛚᛄ -> ᛢᛁᛣᛚᛄ​</summary>
    <p>quickly</p>
</details>

It's worth noting that all of these shortcuts are optional. I would imagine some scenarios such as a crossword puzzle where it would benefit us to avoid using shortcut runes.

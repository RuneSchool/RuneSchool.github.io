This lesson is all about shortcuts!

The rune for the sound in <strong>Y</strong>OU is <mark>ᛄ</mark>.

This rune will never come at the end of a word.

The rune for the vowel sound in N<strong>EO</strong>N and ROD<strong>EO</strong> is <mark>ᛇ</mark>.

The rune for the consonant sound in IN<strong>H</strong>UMANE is *also* <mark>ᛇ</mark>.

This is also how you pronounce the famous composer's name most accurately.

This was a very strange rune for being both a consonant and a vowel. The vowel sound is sort of the brother to ᛠ. You can sort of think of them like this:

```
ᛠ = ᛁ + ᛟ
ᛇ = ᛁ + ᚩ
```

And the consonant sound is pretty rare in modern English. So you will be able to tell when it is a consonant vs a vowel based on usage.

I have to say, because of its strangeness, this rune became one of my favorites.

Now we come to two runes that are actually shortcuts.

The rune for the sound in PA<strong>ST</strong> and <strong>ST</strong>OP is <mark>ᛥ</mark>.

It is a shortcut for writing ᛋᛏ.

    <p>start</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚩᚢᛥ</summary>
    <p>post</p>
</details>

You would not use this rune if you need to have a doubled consonant like in the British pronunciation of "Lost" (ᛚᚩᛋᛋᛏ) or if you have the S and T sounds split across two syllables like "pastime".

The rune for the sound in <strong>QU</strong>ICK and <strong>QU</strong>EEN is <mark>ᛢ</mark>.


<details>
    <summary>ᛢᛁᚾ</summary>
    <p>queen</p>
</details>

It's worth noting that both ᛥ and ᛢ are very much optional. You can choose to use ᛋᛏ and ᛣᚹ instead.

    <summary>ᛈᚩᚢᛋᛏ</summary>
    <p>post</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛣᚹᛁᚾ</summary>
    <p>queen</p>
</details>

Guess what? We covered a lot of runes that are never doubled in this lesson. 

ᛇ, ᛢ, and ᛥ are considered clusters that are never doubled. Just like ᛝ, ᛋᚳ, and ᛉᚳ.

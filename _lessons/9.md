This lesson is all about shortcuts!

Up to now, you've been writing the "ee" sound like ᛁᛄ. But there's a shortcut for that.

<details>
    <summary>ᛁᛄᛉᛡ᛫​ᛈᛁᛄᛉᛡ</summary>
    <p>easy peasy</p>
</details>

Another way to write the <strong>ᛁᛄ</strong> sound is with the rune <mark>ᛇ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᛁᛄᛋ -> ᛈᛇᛋ</summary>
    <p>peace</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛁᛄᛉᛡ᛫​ᛈᛁᛄᛉᛡ -> ᛇᛉᛡ᛫​ᛈᛇᛉᛡ</summary>
    <p>easy peasy</p>
</details>

Imagine that you combined ᛁ and ᛄ together. You cut the center part of ᛄ in half and stuck them on the ends of ᛁ.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛚᛁᛄᛉ -> ᛋᛚᛇᛉ</summary>
    <p>sleaze</p>
</details>

The rune for the consonant sound in <strong>H</strong>UMANE and lo<strong>ch</strong> is *also* <mark>ᛇ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚻᛄᚣᚹᛋᛏᚾ -> ᛇᚣᚹᛋᛏᚾ</summary>
    <p>Houston</p>
</details>

This is also how you pronounce the famous composer's name most accurately.

<details>
    <summary>ᛒᚪᛣ -> ᛒᚪᛇ</summary>
    <p>Bach</p>
</details>

Another way to write the <strong>ᛁᛁ</strong> sound is with the rune <mark>ᛠ</mark>.

<details>
    <summary>ᚾᛁᛁᚱ -> ᚾᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>near</p>
</details>

Imagine if you combined ᛁ and ᛁ together. You just lay one on top of the other and boom.

<details>
    <summary>ᛚᛁᛁ -> ᛚᛠ</summary>
    <p>Leah</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛁᛁᚱ -> ᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>ear</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚻᛁᛁᚱ -> ᚻᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>here / hear</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚱᛁᛁᛚ -> ᚱᛠᛚ</summary>
    <p>real</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛁᚾᛋᛁᛁᚱ -> ᛋᛁᚾᛋᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>sincere</p>
</details>

Take your time with these. Sound them out slowly.

<details>
    <summary>ᚪᛄᛞᛠᛚᚪᛄᛉ</summary>
    <p>idealize</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛒᚱᛁᚸᛟᛞᛠᚱ</summary>
    <p>brigadier</p>
</details>

The rune for the sound in PA<strong>ST</strong> and <strong>ST</strong>OP is <mark>ᛥ</mark>.

It is a shortcut for writing ᛋᛏ.

<details>
    <summary>ᛋᛏᚪᚱᛏ -> ᛥᚪᚱᛏ</summary>
    <p>start</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᛈᚢᚹᛋᛏ -> ᛈᚢᚹᛥ</summary>
    <p>post</p>
</details>

You would not use this rune if you have the S and T sounds split across two syllables like "pastime".

The rune for the sound in <strong>QU</strong>ICK and <strong>QU</strong>EEN is <mark>ᛢ</mark>.

It is a shortcut for ᚳᚹ.

<details>
    <summary>ᚳᚹᛇᚾ᛫​ᛒᛁᛄ -> ᛢᛇᚾ᛫​ᛒᛇ</summary>
    <p>queen bee</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>ᚳᚹᛁᛣᛚᛡ -> ᛢᛁᛣᛚᛡ​</summary>
    <p>quickly</p>
</details>

It's worth noting that both ᛥ and ᛢ are very much optional. You can choose to use ᛋᛏ and ᚳᚹ instead.

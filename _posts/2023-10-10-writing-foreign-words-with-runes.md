If English started to use Runes, it would be necessary to write words from foreign languages in everyday communication.

## Spanish

Spanish has 5 open vowels. In Latin letters, this is just AEIOU "ah eh ee oh oo". In our runic system for English, that would be ᚪᛖᛁᚩᚢ. We would simply not use any doubled consonants after any of these vowel runes.

ᚪ ᛖ ᛖ ᚢ ᚩ ᛁ ᚩ

Now I'm not sure how we would handle accurately writing the accent marks to indicate stress. If you're at the point of needing that, it would probably be best to just write Spanish with their native alphabet (Latin letters) :)

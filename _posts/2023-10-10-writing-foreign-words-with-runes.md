If English started to use Runes, it would be necessary to write words from foreign languages in everyday communication.

Using this runic system, how would we do that?

## Five open vowels

Some languages like Spanish and Japanese have just five open vowels. In Latin letters, these are just AEIOU "ah eh ee oh oo". In our runic system for English, that would be ᚪ ᛖ ᛁ ᚩ ᚢ. We would simply not use any doubled consonants after any of these vowel runes to emulate these sounds.

## Accents / Stress

Now I'm not sure how we would handle accurately writing the accent marks to indicate stress. If you're at the point of needing that, it would probably be best to just write Spanish with their native alphabet (Latin letters) :)

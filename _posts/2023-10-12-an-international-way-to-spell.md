If you are writing Runic English for an international audience, you may want to spell in a manner that is equally easily understood by all English accents. Imagine you are writing a news article or a future best-selling book, for example. The chances are high that you don't want to rewrite the whole text in 4 different editions for 4 different accents. You will likely want the content to feel equally comfortable for all audiences.

For the most part, Rune School already teaches a system that works well for international audiences. For example, it doesn't matter if a person in Scotland pronounces "mouth" differently from a person in America. Both will use the rune ᚣ.

There are, however, a few cases in which whole phonemes will differ across different accents. These usually involve the following issues:

- rhoticity
- yods
- changing phonemes

The best way to handle these issues is for *everyone* to make a few compromises. The end result of these compromises will be a new sort of Mid-Atlantic / Trans-Atlantic accent in written form.

## Rhoticity

Some accents are rhotic (pronounces the R), while others are non-rhotic (doesn't pronounce the R). The solution to this however is to write the R, even when it is not pronounced. This is because non-rhotic accents (like most British accents), are already used to writing the R in Latin English spelling. So it's no leap for them to do so in Runic English spelling. Therefore, non-rhotic accents already mentally distinguish words like "saw" from "soar" despite them often being pronounced the same.

**Keep the R.**

## Yods

Now since the British (non-rhotics) make a compromise by adding in the Rs when they don't pronounce them, it's only fair if the Americans make a compromise as well. Their compromise would be to add in the yods.

A "yod" is the first sound in the word "you". In the International Phonetic Alphabet it is portrayed as `/j/`.

British people pronounce words like "new", and "dune" with a yod before the "u", while Americans do not. 

But what about yod coalescence? Coalescence is when the yod combines with the next sound to produce a totally different sound. Words like "tune" and "dune" will often turn into "choon" and "june". In these words, the solution is to simply write the yod and leave it at that. The reason this is a good solution is because there are too many different ways that yod coalescence can manifest. Instead of writing "dune" in 3 different ways ("doon", "dyoon", "june"), we just write it one way. Here are how these would look:

- Dew/due = ᛞᛄᚢ
- Dune = ᛞᛄᚢᚾ
- Do = ᛞᚢ (no yod)
- Tune = ᛏᛄᚢᚾ
- Tube = ᛏᛄᚢᛒ
- New = ᚾᛄᚢ

**Keep the Yod.** *And avoid coalescence.*

## Lexical Sets

Not all accents have the same lexical sets. For example, British people have merged FORCE into NORTH and Americans have broken LOT up and pushed it into either THOUGHT or SPA.

For this reason, a balanced view of the lexical sets to use would be the following:

|    LS   |   RP   |    GA   | en-Runr |   Spelled Out  |
|:-------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
|   TRAP  |    æ   |    æ    | ᚫ       | ᛏᚱᚫᛈ           |
|   BATH  |   ɑː   |    æ    | ᚫ / ᚪ   | ᛒᚫᚦ / ᛒᚪᚦ      |
|   SPA   |   ɑː   |    ɑ    | ᚪ       | ᛋᛈᚪ           |
|   LOT   |    ɒ   |         | ᚩ       | ᛚᚩᛏᛏ           |
|  CLOTH  |   ɒ    |   ɔ, ɑ  | ᚩ       | ᚳᛚᚩᚦᚦ           |
| THOUGHT |   ɔː   |         | ᚩ       | ᚦᚩᛏ            |
|   KIT   |    ɪ   |         | ᛁ       | ᛣᛁᛏᛏ           |
|  DRESS  |    e   |    ɛ    | ᛖ       | ᛞᚱᛖᛋ          |
|  STRUT  |    ʌ   |         | ᚪ       | ᛥᚱᚪᛏᛏ / ᛋᛏᚱᚪᛏᛏ |
|   FOOT  |    ʊ   |         | ᚢ       | ᚠᚢᛏᛏ           |
|   FACE  |   eɪ   |         | ᛖᛡ      | ᚠᛖᛡᛋ           |
|   GOAT  |   əʊ   |    oʊ   | ᚩᚢ      | ᚸᚩᚢᛏ           |
|  FLEECE |   iː   |    i    | ᛁ       | ᚠᛚᛁᛋ           |
|  GOOSE  |   uː   |    u    | ᚢ      | ᚸᚢᛋ            |
|  PRICE  |   aɪ   |         | ᚪᛡ      | ᛈᚱᚪᛡᛋ          |
|  CHOICE |   ɔɪ   |         | ᚩᛡ      | ᚳᚩᛡᛋ           |
|  MOUTH  |   aʊ   |         | ᚣ       | ᛗᚣᚦ            |
|  NURSE  |   ɜː   |    ɜr   | ᛟᚱ      | ᚾᛟᚱᛋ           |
|  START  |   ɑː   |    ɑr   | ᚪᚱ      | ᛥᚪᚱᛏ / ᛋᛏᚪᚱᛏ   |
|  NORTH  |   ɔː   |    ɔr   | ᚩᚱ      | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ           |
|  FORCE  |   ɔː   | ɔr, oʊr | ᚩᚱ      | ᚠᚩᚱᛋ           |
|   NEAR  |   ɪə   |    ir   | ᛠᚱ      | ᚾᛠᚱ            |
|  SQUARE |   ɛː   |    ɛr   | ᛖᚱ      | ᛋᛢᛖᚱ / ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ   |
|   CURE  | ʊə, ɔː |    ʊr   | ᛄᚢᚱ     | ᚳᛄᚢᚱ          |
|  COMMA  |    ə   |    ə    | ᛟ       | ᛣᚩᛗᛗᛟ           |
|  LETTER |    ə   |    ər   | ᛟᚱ     | ᛚᛖᛏᛟᚱ          |
|  HAPPY  |    i   |         | ᛁ       | ᚻᚫᛈᛁ           |

This would have Americans compromise on LOT by just writing ᚩ followed by two consonants even if they personally pronounce the word closer to SPA or THOUGHT. I think this is fair because the way that the LOT words shift for Americans is often a bit unpredictable.

Note that the BATH lexical set would allow for whatever the author prefers.

### Mergers

**Keep Merry-Mary-Marry distinct.**

- Merry = ᛖᚱᚱ
- Mary = ᛖᚱ
- Marry = ᚫᚱ

See these examples from the book [Lexical Sets for Actors](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/2-dress-lexical-set/#mergers) for how this looks in practice:

> The <span style="color:blue">merry</span> <span style="color:green">fairy</span> named <span style="color:green">Mary</span> took the <span style="color:blue">ferry</span> to <span style="color:red">marry</span> <span style="color:green">hairy</span> <span style="color:red">Harry</span> in <span style="color:red">Paris</span>.

> ᚦᛟ᛫<span style="color:blue">​ᛗᛖᚱᚱᛁ</span>᛫<span style="color:green">​ᚠᛖᚱᛁ</span>᛫​ᚾᛖᛡᛗᛞ᛫<span style="color:green">​ᛗᛖᚱᛁ</span>᛫​ᛏᚢᛣᛣ᛫​ᚦᛟ᛫<span style="color:blue">​ᚠᛖᚱᚱᛁ</span>᛫​ᛏᚢ᛫<span style="color:red">​ᛗᚫᚱᛁ</span>᛫<span style="color:green">​ᚻᛖᚱᛁ</span>᛫<span style="color:red">​ᚻᚫᚱᛁ</span>᛫​ᛁᚾᚾ᛫<span style="color:red">​ᛈᚫᚱᛁᛋᛋ</span>᛫​᛬​

> I was <span style="color:green">scared to be on the <span style="color:blue">terrace</span> as the floor was ​<span style="color:red">transparent</span> and it was <span style="color:blue">very</span> ​<span style="color:red">narrow</span> and <span style="color:green">precarious</span>.

> ᚪᛡ᛫​ᚹᚩᛉᛉ᛫<span style="color:green">​ᛋᛣᛖᚱᛞ</span>᛫​ᛏᚢ᛫​ᛒᛁ᛫​ᚩᚾᚾ᛫​ᚦᛟ᛫<span style="color:blue">​ᛏᛖᚱᚱᛟᛋ</span>᛫​ᚫᛉ᛫​ᚦᛟ᛫​ᚠᛚᚩᚱ᛫​ᚹᚩᛉᛉ᛫​<span style="color:red">ᛏᚱᚫᚾᛉᛈᚫᚱᛟᚾᛏ</span>᛫​ᚫᚾᛞ᛫​ᛁᛏᛏ᛫​ᚹᚩᛉᛉ᛫<span style="color:blue">​ᚠᛖᚱᚱᛁ</span>᛫​<span style="color:red">ᚾᚫᚱᚩᚢ</span>᛫​ᚫᚾᛞ᛫<span style="color:green">​ᛈᚱᛟᛣᛖᚱᛠᛋ</span>᛫​᛬​

> <span style="color:blue">ᚷᛖᚱᚱᛟᛚᛞ</span>᛫​ᛏᚩᚢᛚᛞ᛫<span style="color:red">​ᛒᚫᚱᛁ</span>᛫​ᛁᛏᛏ᛫​ᚹᚩᛉᛉ᛫<span style="color:blue">​ᚾᛖᛋᛟᛋᛖᚱᚱᛁ</span>᛫​ᚦᚫᛏ᛫​ᚦᛖᛡ᛫​<span style="color:green">ᛈᚱᛟᛈᛖᚱ</span>᛫​ᚦᛟ᛫​ᚱᛁᛝ᛫<span style="color:green">​ᛒᛖᚱᛟᚱ</span>᛫​ᛒᛟᚠᚩᚱ᛫​ᚦᛟ᛫<span style="color:red">​ᛗᚫᚱᛟᚷ</span>᛫<span style="color:blue">​ᛋᛖᚱᚱᛟᛗᚩᚢᚾᛁ</span>᛫​᛬​

In Accents where Merry-Mary-Marry are all merged, these would all just be ᛖᚱ.

**Keep Hurry and Furry distinct.**

- Hurry = ᚪᚱᚱ
- Furry = ᛟᚱ

In accents where Hurry and Furry are merged, these would both be ᛟᚱ.

**Keep North and Force merged.** Both as just ᚩᚱ.

In General American, North would be ᚩᚱ and Force would be ᚩᚢᚱ.

**Keep fur, fern, and fir merged.** All as ᛟᚱ.

In some accents like Scottish, these can all be pronounced differently like ​ᚠᚢᚱ, ​ᚠᛖᚱᚾ, ​ᚠᛁᚱᚱᚾ. 

## When not to be international

We always want to spell names as accurately as possible regardless of wanting to be international, however. 

If you're talking about an American "Tom", you would likely spell his name like ᛏᚪᛗ. If you're writing about a British "Tom", you would likely spell his name like ᛏᚩᛗᛗ. The same is true of last names.

**Respect context.**

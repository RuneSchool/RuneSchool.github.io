If you are writing for an international audience, you may want to spell in a manner that is equally easily understood by all accents. This will inevitably require everyone to make a few compromises.

- keep the Rs
- keep the Yods
- use the LOT lexical set


I like to spell the LOT words with ᚩ followed by a double consonant even though I am an American, because I think that is a good compromise for an international way to spell and most often reflects the historical latin spelling anyway. But 

We always want to spell names as accurately as possible regardless of wanting to be international, however. If you're an American "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚪᛗ. If you're a British "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚩᛗᛗ.

If you are writing Runic English for an international audience, you may want to spell in a manner that is equally easily understood by all English accents. Imagine you are writing a news article or a future best-selling book. The chances are high that you don't want to rewrite the whole text in 4 different editions for 4 different accents.

For the most part, Rune School already teaches a system that works well for international audiences. For example, it doesn't matter if a person in Scotland pronounces "mouth" differently from a person in America. Both will use the rune ᚣ.

There are, however, a few cases in which whole phonemes will differ across different accents.

- rhoticity
- yod coalescence
- Lexical sets

The best way to handle this is for *everyone* to make a few compromises.

- keep the Rs
- keep the Yods
- use the LOT lexical set


I like to spell the LOT words with ᚩ followed by a double consonant even though I am an American, because I think that is a good compromise for an international way to spell and most often reflects the historical latin spelling anyway. But 

## When not to be "international"

We always want to spell names as accurately as possible regardless of wanting to be international, however. If you're an American "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚪᛗ. If you're a British "Tom", you would likely spell your name like ᛏᚩᛗᛗ.

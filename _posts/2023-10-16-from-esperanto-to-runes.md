description: How I arrived at the idea of runic revival
---

I have long been interested in the problem of communication. 

I first watched videos of polyglots on youtube (laozu, mezzofanti guild, etc). But learning a natural language like French or Chinese was too much for a complete beginner like myself. 

Eventually, I came across Esperanto. This was the first time that I experienced the joy of being able to express myself in a different language.

I soon realized some faults in Esperanto and began to explore other International Auxiliary Languages like Lingwa De Planeta. 

Then I realized that a global language may not be ideal because if it ever took off across the world, it could erase minority languages. I find diversity to be a good thing, so I would hope to preserve such minority languages.

That realization led me to the idea of [zonal languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonal_auxiliary_language) as a kind of compromise. They felt cozy. Zonal languages weren‚Äôt imposing anything on the world. They were just tidying up an already existing language family and presenting it in a neat package for others to learn more easily, if they so wanted to. And in learning a zonal language, one could easily learn other natural languages within the same family. Diversity is preserved.

Then I began to think of my own native language (English). There was in the background this whole time that ‚ÄúEnglish is already the global language!‚Äù While this is true, I had a few problems with that.

One, I wasn‚Äôt sure that I even liked the fact that English was the global language. Everyone else gets to have their native language AND English. A language for their family/people, and a language for everyone else. But there I was stuck with just English. English didn‚Äôt feel special to me or my people/culture. Everyone spoke English. What if I want a home language too? Part of the reason I dreamt of a different global language was so that I could have English just for myself. My home language.

And Two, if English is the global language, why is it so hard to spell?

Granted, even if English was not the global language, it would still be hard to spell even for native speakers.

So at this point there were two options for me. Promote a zonal language as an International Auxliary Language and/or improve the spelling of English.

Now the only issue with a zonal language is that everyone would still need to learn this language. Much of it would be at-sight understandable, but not all of it. It would still take work. So basically, a person would be given two choices: learn the zonal language or just jump ahead and learn the biggest language in that zone. It‚Äôs a tough choice to make in some cases. In any case, I still support Occidental as the western european zonal language. However, I‚Äôm not fully satisfied with it. 

Now I want to focus on the ‚Äúimprove the spelling of English‚Äù option.

Much has been said and proposed about spelling reform of the english language in the past, but nothing will ever be accepted. Words are like old friends. When you propose a change of spelling to such old friends, the people will naturally react in disgust and anger. Proposing a totally new script would be easier.

I then discovered Shavian. It is a good writing system (great, in fact), but it has inconsistencies that are the result of the creator‚Äôs simple opinion or even mistake. I think that the script would be just fine if these two pairs were reversed: êëô/êë£, êë∫/êëª. See [Why Not Shavian](/why-not-shavian) for more.

But the bottom line is that it would just be too difficult to get the community on board with such a change. There is not too much historical baggage to allow for this change today, but they believe that there is. Ultimately, if a script is created arbitrarily, it can be changed arbitrarily. That is the rub.

Now what if there was a script that had historical precedent that could not be changed arbitrarily? For English, that script would be the Anglo-Saxon runes. The creation of these runes are shrouded in mystery. No one knows where they came from exactly. Even if the runes were created arbitrarily, they cannot be changed because of the long history attached to them. There is a chain that cannot be broken.

Runes are the English speaker‚Äôs birthright. Does each rune have a deep meaning? It does not matter, in my opinion. They are simply letters at the end of the day. The sooner we use runes as regular letters, the better.

So now, we have a solution to the English spelling issue. We have a script that is (1) free from latin spelling baggage, and (2) is not arbitrary. 

But most importantly, are runes a better alternative to latin letters? I believe that they are. But why not find out for yourself?

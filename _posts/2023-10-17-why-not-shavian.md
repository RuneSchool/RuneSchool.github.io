Shavian is a good writing system (great, in fact), but it has inconsistencies that are the result of the creator’s simple opinion or even mistake. 

## 𐑙𐑣

In Shavian today, 𐑙 is for a voiced sound and 𐑣 is for an unvoiced sound. The problem is that in Shavian, tall letters are unvoiced and deep letters are voiced. This is a consistent rule. But Reed wanted the “ng” letter (𐑙) to be tall just for the fact that he thought it looked better as 𐑦𐑙 (-ing). But this is subjective. 𐑦𐑣 would look just as good and it would have the benefit of being consistent. 

Why does this consistency matter? Because in English there are phonemic rules like “plurals use a /z/ sound when after a short or deep letter, and they use a /s/ after a tall letter”. If you don’t have consistency with the letters, you need to have silly exceptions for things like 𐑙. An exception to a rule is yet another burden on a user of English and defeats the purpose of Shavian to begin with. It’s not worth preserving the mere opinion of Reed to have this exception.

## 𐑺𐑻

Now why reverse 𐑺/𐑻? These two letters are compound letters. They are some letter + 𐑮 /r/. The tricky part is that in unicode, we do not have these first letters at all. We only have the compound version. So what exactly are these first letters? Well, they are 𐑩𐑩 and 𐑧𐑧.

Do you see it?

𐑩𐑩𐑮 = 𐑺
𐑧𐑧𐑮 = 𐑻

Now here’s the issue: In Shavian today, 𐑺 is the letter that sounds like 𐑧𐑧 and 𐑻 is the letter that sounds like 𐑩𐑩.

In order for Shavian learners to connect with or have any idea of what these compound letters are, they need to be reversed so that visually they have some link with how they sound.

## 𐑕𐑟

One final inconsistency with Shavian is that this pair of unvoiced and voiced consonants are only flipped vertically and *not* mirrored.

All other consonant pairs are *mirrored* as well as *flipped vertically*. Look at all of these pairs below. Take the first letter and mirror it from left to right. Then flip it upside down.

𐑑𐑛 𐑓𐑝 𐑒𐑜 𐑐𐑚 𐑔𐑞 𐑑𐑛 𐑗𐑡 𐑖𐑠 𐑕𐑟

Every single pair follows this pattern except for 𐑕𐑟. And why? I would assume that it is because of the designer's opinion that it looks better that way or that you need a paralell to the latin s and z.

In any case, this is the kind of thing that just will not do for a so called "planned" script. 

## Why these are a problem

Inconsistencies are accepted in natural (unplanned) scripts. This is because they have hundreds or thousands of years of evolution alongside their users. The script is a part of the people that created and used it.

But for an artificial (planned) script, these things are unacceptable. It is your chance to make a neat and clean system and you choose not to?

But the bottom line is that it is just too difficult to get the community on board with making these changes. There is *not* too much historical baggage to allow for this change today, but they believe that there *is*. 

Ultimately, if a script is *created arbitrarily, it can be *changed arbitrarily*. That is the rub. But what if a script was not created arbitrarily and was equally as helpful as Shavian?

## The place of an alternative script alongside latin

It is highly likely that the Latin script will remain dominant in the English world for a long time. Afterall, the Latin script connects much of the world together! If English were to get rid of it entirely, it could do much damage in terms of being a major part of the connected world.

However, there can very well be a place for an alternative orthography alongside it. A script that is phonemic and thus rooted in how English actually sounds. This would be a truly useful tool for English speakers.

What kind of script would be accepted as an alternative spelling system? If it were entirely consistent and logical, a planned (artificial) script could be accepted, yes. But the [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) would never cease. Some would claim that only a few things are inconsistent while others would claim that a few inconsistencies are what is needed to emulate a natural script, etc.

This leaves us with an unplanned (natural) script. What sort of natural script would be accepted as an alternative spelling tool for English? It would have to be one that is rooted in the English language itself. English speakers would not accept using Cyrillic or Georgian or Devanagari. This leaves us with Runes.

Runes are capable of providing the same phonemic spelling benefits as Shavian, with none of the complaints of inconsistencies or illogicality. Latin orthography could remain the Orthodox and Traditional spelling while Runes are a more clear speech-to-writing system that is accessible and efficient for the people. This was essentially the place of [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Creation) amongst the Koreans for about 400 years!

But wait! Hangul is a planned (artificial) script just like Shavian! That is true. But Hangul is also consistent (unlike Shavian), and it had the backing of the government. At one point, it was also intrinsically tied with Korean Nationalism. Even if Shavian was perfectly consistent, and if one English speaking government adopted and promoted it, that doesn't mean that the rest of the English world would follow suit. There is no longer one, single English identity like there is a Korean identity.

For the whole English world, the only way to get to a single English identity is to go back in time and recover what we have lost. A point in time when the English world was smaller. Take that and move forward into the future.

## Flexibility

If there is no universal backing from all English nations, the writing system needs to be flexible enough to account for multiple English accents and to adapt with the language itself.

Shavian is technically a flexible writing system. Users can spell how they want to spell. However, there are some things like how the NURSE and SQUARE vowels are permanently attached to the following R letter that make it sort of rigid.

And what is Shavian to do if in the future a pronunciation split (like [Bad-Lad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_English_%E2%9F%A8a%E2%9F%A9#Bad%E2%80%93lad_split) etc)becomes truly phonemic?

Runes are flexible enough to account for all of this.

## Conclusion

Shavian is a fine writing system. It would be an excellent tool to live alongside Latin script for English speakers today. And indeed, many Shavian users use it exactly like that! I have a hundred pages of handwritten notes in Shavian.

However, I cannot ignore the flaws in Shavian that I think all but ensure that it will never see true adoption.

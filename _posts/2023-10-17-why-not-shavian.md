Shavian is a good writing system (great, in fact). I read and write it comfortably. But it has inconsistencies. 

These inconsistencies may be something that only I personally find annoying, but nonetheless, they highlight the fact that these things are ultimately arbitrary and the result of the creator’s opinion or oversight.

## Voiced and Unvoiced Dilemma

In Shavian today, 𐑙 is for a voiced sound and 𐑣 is for an unvoiced sound. The problem is that in Shavian, tall letters are unvoiced and deep letters are voiced. This is a consistent rule. But Reed wanted the “ng” letter (𐑙) to be tall just for the fact that he thought it looked better as 𐑦𐑙 (-ing). But this is subjective. 𐑦𐑣 would look just as good and it would have the benefit of being consistent. 

Why does this consistency matter? Because in English there are phonemic rules like “plurals use a /z/ sound when after a short or deep letter, and they use a /s/ after a tall letter”. If you don’t have consistency with the letters, you need to have silly exceptions for things like 𐑙. An exception to a rule is yet another burden on a user of English and defeats the purpose of Shavian to begin with. It’s not worth preserving the mere opinion of Reed to have this exception.

Now you may be thinking, "what about 𐑘 and 𐑢? 𐑘 (/j/) is voiced and it's a tall letter!" That is correct, but 

## SQUARE and NURSE Reversal

Now why reverse 𐑺/𐑻? These two letters are compound letters. They are some letter + 𐑮 /r/. The tricky part is that in unicode, we do not have these first letters at all. We only have the compound version. So what exactly are these first letters? Well, they are 𐑩𐑩 and 𐑧𐑧.

Do you see it?

𐑩𐑩𐑮 = 𐑺
𐑧𐑧𐑮 = 𐑻

Now here’s the issue: In Shavian today, 𐑺 is the letter that sounds like 𐑧𐑧 and 𐑻 is the letter that sounds like 𐑩𐑩.

In order for Shavian learners to connect with or have any idea of what these compound letters are, they need to be reversed so that visually they have some link with how they sound.

## 𐑕𐑟

One final inconsistency with Shavian is that this pair of unvoiced and voiced consonants are only flipped vertically and *not* mirrored.

All other consonant pairs are *mirrored* as well as *flipped vertically*. Look at all of these pairs below. Take the first letter and mirror it from left to right. Then flip it upside down.

𐑑𐑛 𐑓𐑝 𐑒𐑜 𐑐𐑚 𐑔𐑞 𐑑𐑛 𐑗𐑡 𐑖𐑠 𐑕𐑟

Every single pair follows this pattern except for 𐑕𐑟. And why? I would assume that it is because of the designer's opinion that it looks better that way or that you need a paralell to the latin s and z.

In any case, this is the kind of thing that just will not do for a so called "planned" script. 

## Why these are a problem

Inconsistencies are accepted in natural (unplanned) scripts. This is because they have hundreds or thousands of years of evolution alongside their users. The script is a part of the people that created and used it.

But for an artificial (planned) script, these things are unacceptable. It is your chance to make a neat and clean system and you choose not to?

But the bottom line is that it is just too difficult to get the community on board with making these changes. There is *not* too much historical baggage to allow for this change today, but they believe that there *is*. 

Ultimately, if a script is *created arbitrarily, it can be *changed arbitrarily*. That is the rub. But what if a script was not created arbitrarily and was equally as helpful as Shavian?



## Flexibility

If there is no universal backing from all English nations, the writing system needs to be flexible enough to account for multiple English accents and to adapt with the language itself.

Shavian is technically a flexible writing system. Users can spell how they want to spell. However, there are some things like how the NURSE and SQUARE vowels are permanently attached to the following R letter that make it sort of rigid.

And what is Shavian to do if in the future a pronunciation split (like [Bad-Lad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_English_%E2%9F%A8a%E2%9F%A9#Bad%E2%80%93lad_split) etc)becomes truly phonemic?

Runes are flexible enough to account for all of this.

## Conclusion

Shavian is a fine writing system. It would be an excellent tool to live alongside Latin script for English speakers today. And indeed, many Shavian users use it exactly like that! I have a hundred pages of handwritten notes in Shavian.

However, I cannot ignore the flaws in Shavian that I think all but ensure that it will never see true adoption.

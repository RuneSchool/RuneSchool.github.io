I then discovered Shavian. It is a good writing system (great, in fact), but it has inconsistencies that are the result of the creator’s simple opinion or even mistake. I think that the script would be just fine if these two pairs were reversed: 𐑙/𐑣, 𐑺/𐑻. See [Appendix A](#Appendix-A) for more.

But the bottom line is that it would just be too difficult to get the community on board with such a change. There is not too much historical baggage to allow for this change today, but they believe that there is. Ultimately, if a script is created arbitrarily, it can be changed arbitrarily. That is the rub.



In Shavian today, 𐑙 is for a voiced sound and 𐑣 is for an unvoiced sound. The problem is that in Shavian, tall letters are unvoiced and deep letters are voiced. This is a consistent rule. But Reed wanted the “ng” letter (𐑙) to be tall just for the fact that he thought it looked better as 𐑦𐑙 (-ing). But this is subjective. 𐑦𐑣 would look just as good and it would have the benefit of being consistent. 

Why does this consistency matter? Because in English there are phonemic rules like “plurals use a /z/ sound when after a short or deep letter, and they use a /s/ after a tall letter”. If you don’t have consistency with the letters, you need to have silly exceptions for things like 𐑙. An exception to a rule is yet another burden on a user of English and defeats the purpose of Shavian to begin with. It’s not worth preserving the mere opinion of Reed to have this exception.

Now why reverse 𐑺/𐑻? These two letters are compound letters. They are some letter + 𐑮 /r/. The tricky part is that in unicode, we do not have these first letters at all. We only have the compound version. So what exactly are these first letters? Well, they are 𐑩𐑩 and 𐑧𐑧.

Do you see it?

𐑩𐑩𐑮 = 𐑺
𐑧𐑧𐑮 = 𐑻

Now here’s the issue: In Shavian today, 𐑺 is the letter that sounds like 𐑧𐑧 and 𐑻 is the letter that sounds like 𐑩𐑩.

In order for Shavian learners to connect with or have any idea of what these compound letters are, they need to be reversed so that visually they have some link with how they sound.

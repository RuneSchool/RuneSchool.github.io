## Why variable height is good

One of the draws of Shavian is that it is a variable height script. This means that it has descending letters, ascending letters, and short letters that stay in the middle. Latin spelling is like this too, as you can see right now.

Part of the idea behind this is that it's easier to scan text quickly and visually recognize words if they have different "shapes" to them. 

However, Runes are a single-height script. So you lose some of the benefit of that at-a-glance recognizability. Or do you... ?

Supposedly single-height is harder to read. Afterall, the Deseret Alphabet was lambasted for being hard to read because it was single-height. But let's consider some other scripts that are effectively single-height: Russian (Cyrillic), Chinese, and Korean (Hangeul). The fact that people can read these scripts just fine tells me that it's about being accustomed to it. The single-height script is not inherently hard to read. Otherwise these cultures would struggle with literacy and reading, which they clearly do not!

Now the downside of runes being single-height then is just that English speakers need to adjust to it. It's hard to go from a variable-height script like latin, to a single-height like runes. In that sense, the Shavian script is an easier transition. The question in my mind now is how hard of a transition this really is. It remains to be seen!

## Why variable height is bad

Now there are situations in which you would want to make the text single-height. Mostly for aesthetic purposes. For example, it's hard to not be envious of the beauty of Japanese writing that is satisfyingly lined up. But also, one might want to force a single-height for very large text that needs to be very readable.

One thing I realized however, is that it's easier to make a single-height script into a variable-height script than it is to make a variable-height into a single-height. 

For example, some Shavian letters are *only* distinguished by their height. If you make everything single-height in Shavian, it is confusing and difficult to read.

However, someone could easily design a font for runes that is variable height. Perhaps a future font will make the vowels (ᚫᛖᚢᛁᛄᛟᚣᚩᛠᛡ) short and make the consonants (ᛞᚻᛏᚾᛋᛚᚳᚱᚸᚠᛈᚷᛣᛒᛗᚹᚦᛉᛝᛇ) ascend or descend. There are many options for how it could work and the readability is not harmed by this experimentation. The question that I still have though is, is it necessary. For artistic purposes, it's fun to experiment. But practically, I keep going back to Japanese, Chinese, Russian... they have no issue with this single-height issue.

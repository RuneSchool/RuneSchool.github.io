You may be asking yourself, "Why not just improve English spelling as it is today? Wouldn't that be easier than adopting a whole new (old) alphabet?" 

# French

Spelling reform is certainly possible. It has been done to the French language and I'm sure many others. But the contexts in which those reforms were accepted were quite different. If you look at the [history of French spelling reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforms_of_French_orthography), it only works in a context where a few publishers have much more influence. 

>  new reforms suggested in 1901, 1935, and 1975 were almost totally ignored, except for the replacement of apostrophes with hyphens in some cases of (potential) elision in 1935.

Now in the modern era, there are certain "publishers" that could be influenced to comply with a kind of reform. But the modern equivalent are more like Operating Systems than book publishers:

>  Microsoft announced that the French version of their applications would soon comply with the new spelling rules.

# English

[Much has been said and proposed about spelling reform of the English language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform) in the past, but my opinion is that no reform will ever be accepted. 

Why not? If a reform could be decided on, then Microsoft, Apple, and Google could implement it in their operating systems and influence the English world! In this case, the problem is not the publisher support but rather the reform itself.

English is too widespread for a single reform to ever be decided on. As you can see in the link above, there are too many options for reforms with differing ideas of what English Orthography *should be*. One could suggest conservative reforms such as writing "color" instead of "colour", but as we can see, such a simple reform was accepted in America and rejected in England. Good luck deciding on a reform more substantial than that.

## Philosophical Objection

Words are like old friends. When you propose a change of spelling to words that people have used their whole lives, the people will naturally react in disgust and anger. It's like killing their old friends. I believe that this is even moreso the case when spellings of words do *not* match the sound. 

"Friend" could never become "frend". Why? Because even though the spelling makes more sense as "frend", that is not what a friend *is*. I believe that current Latin orthography of English has a stronger *symbolic* connection to the thing itself precisely *because* the orthography does not have a strong *sound* connection. 

The basic idea is that if a word is spelled phonetically (as it sounds), then it's connection is primarily to a spoken word. And the spoken word is the thing that is symbolically connected to an idea. If a word is not spelling phonetically, then it's connection is not to a spoken word but rather to 



```
"friend" -> ðŸ‘­
"frend" ->  /frend/ -> ðŸ‘­
```

The spelling of "freind" goes straight to the idea, it does not go to the phonetic pronunciation first and then to the idea.

## A different way

So the roadblocks are

1. Can't decide on a reform
2. Fundamental disgust at new ways of spelling words

The way to bypass these roadblocks are to use a totally new script.

Proposing a totally new script would be easier.

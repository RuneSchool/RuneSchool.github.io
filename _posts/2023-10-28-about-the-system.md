description: An unofficial attempt to explain the reasoning behind the choices made in Rune Revival's Modern English Futhorc system
hidden: false
---

This article is my attempt at explaining the reasoning behind the choices made in [Rune Revival](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnRunes/)'s runic system taught in this course. It is unofficial and based on my own collection of information.

This runic system, only uses [Anglo-Saxon runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes) with as little changes as possible from the original usage. Where there are changes, there is an order of consideration:

1. The historical record of Anglo Saxon rune usage
2. The era of latin letter usage in England that existed simultaneously with rune usage
3. Rune usage from other areas that pre-dates the Anglo Saxon runes
4. Development from Old English to Modern English
5. Logical appliciation of runic principles
6. Desire to use all of the Anglo-Saxon runes 

The majority of rune usage in this system is taken from #1. We pick up today right where they left off. But in some cases, English today is different from English back then. In these situations, we need to make adjustments and take ideas from #2, #3, and beyond.

## Why doubled consonants

In brief, consonant doubling is from consideration #2.

Modern English has more vowels than Old English. There needs to be a way to represent those. [Modern English has a consonant doubling system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography#Marking_sound_changes_in_other_letters) to indicate short vowels. This [originally came from a very experimental era of English spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormulum#Orthography) that occured around the time that Runes were falling out of usage in England.

English runic spelling originally did not have doubled consonants. But then Latin letters came along and eventually people started to like doubling consonants to indicate short vowels. There are other reasons that Latin letters took over in England. But at least partially, they did represent a superior way of representing English sounds.

The idea is that if Runes had remained in use, they would have borrowed this consonant doubling concept from Latin spelling convention. 

The only other solution that alternative runic spelling systems have come up with for representing Modern English vowels is to use runes in ways that break historical continuity, or to bring foreign runes (like from the Elder or Younger futhark) into the Anglo Saxon futhorc.

The consonant doubling solution allows us to keep the original Anglo-Saxon futhorc while also acknowledging the natural development of English phonology through history.

## The runes

Here is a list of runes so that you can see how this system has kept them the same or changed them. The text is green if it is the same, orange if it slightly different, and red if it is a fairly large difference.

If we accept the doubled consonants system, then the only real changes to address are Double-Feoh, ᚣ, ᛠ, ᛟ, ᛇ, ᛉ, ᛡ, and ᚷ.

| Rune | Consideration | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ᛉ | 3 | Old English didn't have a known sound for ᛉ despite keeping it in their rune rows. Some think that it made the sound of /ks/ like the latin "x", but it is unsure. Going back to the Elder Futhark, this had a /z/ sound, so we just keep that sound. |
| ᛇ | 1, 4 | The consonant sound for this rune is the same, so the only thing to address is the vowel sound. Basically, the Old English pronunciation of /iːw/ and /e͜oːw/ can easily become /i:o/. There is no immediate need for that exact sound, so we apply it to situations where it would be useful like /iˌoʊ/ and /ɪɒ/. |
| ᚷ | 4 | The original sound of ᚷ was /j/, but when French began to influence English after the Norman invasion (~1100), /j/ started to become /dʒ/ in English, [just like in French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_French#To_Early_Old_French[when?]) (Think of how the word Jehovah or Jesus changed in pronunciation over time). So also taking into account that ᛄ is already /j/, we can reduce historical ᚷᚷ to just ᚷ for /dʒ/. |
| ᚣ | 4 | ᚣ originally made a /y(ː)/ sound in Old English. This sound [only exists very rarely in the GOOSE lexical set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) for some accents today (a similar sound /ʉ/ [also appears in the MOUTH lexical set](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/16-mouth-lexical-set/#altpron) for some accents). In Old English, you could hear /y:/ in the word [cow](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cy#Pronunciation) which is part of the MOUTH lexical set today. The idea is that this sound evolved into the MOUTH set, and for this reason, ᚣ takes the MOUTH vowel.|
| ᛠ | 4 | [In Old English, the word "ear" was pronounced like /ˈæ͜ɑː.re/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eare#Old_English), which would have used this rune. Over time, this word "ear" began to sound like /ɪə/. This is partially documented in the Great Vowel Shift where words with "ea" eventually began to sound like words with "ee". There are some people today who [pronounce NEAR like /ɛə̯/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/19-near-lexical-set/#mergers) which also shows a bit of a remnant that still pronounces "ear" closer to how it used to be said. So we can assign this rune to the NEAR lexical set, where the pronunciation has mostly shifted from /æːɑ/ to /iːə/.  |
| ᛟ | 4 | ᛟ originally made a /ø/ sound in Old English. The main occurence of this sound in Modern English is the way that [some English accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) pronounce the NURSE lexical set. Also considering then that [some accents pronounce NURSE with a schwa sound](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/10-nurse-lexical-set/#altpron), this rune takes the NURSE and commA lexical sets.|
| Double-Feoh | 5 | Double-Feoh is applying the same idea behind ᛣ to ᚠ |
| ᛡ | 6, 4 | If we say that ᛡ went through [metathesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metathesis_(linguistics)) and became /oj/, we can use this for the CHOICE, PRICE, and FACE lexical sets. This also lets us form diphthongs in unique ways that help to hold many different pronunciations together. |

Here is a list of [attested runic combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes#Combinations_and_digraphs) and their sound in Modern English Futhorc. Note that not all sounds would even make sense for Modern English:

| Combo | IPA       | Equivalent in Modern English Futhorc   |

| ᚷᚳ        | [gg]?, [dʒ]? | <span style="color:orange"> ᚷ </span> |
| ᚷᚷ        | ~[dʒ]     | <span style="color:orange"> ᚷ </span>   |
| ᚻᚹ        | /ʍ/       | <span style="color:green"> ᚻᚹ </span>     |
| ᚻᛋ        | /ks/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᚳᛋ  </span>     | 
| ᛇᛋ        | /ks/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᚳᛋ </span>  | 
| ᚾᚷ        | /ŋg/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᛝ or ᛝᚸ    </span>   |
| ᛁᚷ        | /ij/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᛁᛡ  </span>     | 
| ᛇᛡ?      | ~/ij/?    | <span style="color:orange"> ᛁᛡ  </span>    |
| ᛋᚳ        | /sk/, /ʃ/ | <span style="color:green"> ᛋᚳ   </span>    | 
| ᛖᚷ        | /ej/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᛖᛡ  </span>    | 
| ᛖᛇ       | ~/ej/, [eʝ]? | <span style="color:red"> ᛖᛡ </span> | 
| ᚪᚢ   | ~/ɑu/ | <span style="color:orange"> ᚣ </span><span style="color:green">(ᚪᚢ is possible if you want to be very specific about pronunciation)</span>  | 
| ᚪᛁ        | /ɑi/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᚪᛡ  </span>      | 
| ᚪᛡ        | /ɑj/?, /ɑx/? | <span style="color:green"> ᚪᛡ </span>| 

One thing that really stands out from this is that ᛡ seems to be an excellent compromise to rune combinations that involve both ᚷ and ᛁ. 

ᛁ + ᚷ = ᛡ 

## Bindrunes

There are 33 regular base runes:

ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳᚷᚹᚻᚾᛁᛄᛇᛈᛉᛋᛏᛒᛖᛗᛚᛝᛟᛞᚪᚫᛠᚣᛣᚸᛢᛥᛡ

There are 16 consonants that could productively be doubled (useful after ["checked" vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checked_and_free_vowels)):

ᛈᛒᛏᛞᛣᚸᚳᚷᛗᚾᚦᚠᛋᛉᛚᚱ

And there are 7 potential vowel bindrunes:

ᚪᛡ᛫​ᚩᛡ᛫​ᛖᛡ᛫​ᚩᚢ᛫​ᚪᚱ᛫​ᚩᚱ᛫​ᛖᚱ

This brings us to a total of **56** runes that a reader would want to be able to recognize on a given basis:

<pre style="font-size:16px;font-family:BabelStoneRunic;">
ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳᚷᚹᚻᚾᛁᛄᛇᛈᛉᛋᛏᛒᛖᛗᛚᛝᛟᛞᚪᚫᛠᚣᛣᚸᛢᛥᛡ᛫​᛫​ᚪ‍ᛡᚩ‍ᛡ​ᛖ‍ᛡᚩ‍ᚢ​ᚪ‍ᚱ​ᚩ‍ᚱᛖ‍ᚱ᛫​᛫​​ᛤᛈ‍ᛈᛒ‍ᛒᛏ‍ᛏᛞ‍ᛞᚸ‍ᚸᚳ‍ᚳᚷ‍ᚷᛗ‍ᛗᚾ‍ᚾᚦ‍ᚦᚠ‍ᚠᛋ‍ᛋᛉ‍ᛉᛚ‍ᛚᚱ‍ᚱ
</pre>

Many of those bindrunes are so clearly just 1+1 that they don't constitute a truly "new" rune. However, I want to be fair and consider them a separate rune in this case.

Now if we have a barebones minimal runic alphabet with as few bindrunes as possible, I think that we would be perfectly fine with around only **35** runes.

<pre style="font-size:16px;font-family:BabelStoneRunic;">

</pre>

Why add the ᛋ double in this minimal runic alphabet? Mainly becuase it is useful in showing clear spellings for words like "mischief".

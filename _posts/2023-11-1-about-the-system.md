In learning this system, you will use only [Anglo-Saxon runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes) with as little changes as possible from the original usage. Where there are changes, there is an order of consideration:

1. The historical record of Anglo Saxon rune usage
2. The era of latin letter usage in England that existed simultaneously with rune usage
3. Rune usage from other areas that pre-dates the Anglo Saxon runes
4. Modern latin letter usage

The majority of rune usage in this system is taken from #1. We pick up today right where they left off. But in some cases, English today is different from English back then. In these situations, we need to make adjustments and take ideas from #2, #3, and #4.

## Why doubled consonants

Modern English has more vowels than Old English. There needs to be a way to represent those. This system has landed on consonant doubling to indicate "short" vowel sounds.

The only other solution is to use runes in ways that they were not intended to be used. Like bringing foreign runes into the Anglo Saxon futhorc, etc.

## The runes

Here is a list of runes so that you can see how this system has kept them the same or changed them.

## Who is this for?

If you speak English natively, but have never learned a language before, fear not! Writing English in runes is still English. This course doesn't require any linguistic knowledge. Any special terms that I use are explained.

If you speak English and know some foreign languages, this course will give you the opportunity to look at English with new eyes. You will think about your native language in terms of phonemes (categories of sounds) rather than in terms of letters.

If you do not speak English natively, but have learned it as a foreign language

This course is for anyone that currently knows English.

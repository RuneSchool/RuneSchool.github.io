In learning this system, you will use only [Anglo-Saxon runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes) with as little changes as possible from the original usage. Where there are changes, there is an order of consideration:

1. The historical record of Anglo Saxon rune usage
2. The era of latin letter usage in England that existed simultaneously with rune usage
3. Rune usage from other areas that pre-dates the Anglo Saxon runes
4. Modern latin letter usage

The majority of rune usage in this system is taken from #1. We pick up today right where they left off. But in some cases, English today is different from English back then. In these situations, we need to make adjustments and take ideas from #2, #3, and #4.

## Why doubled consonants

In brief, consonant doubling is from consideration #2.

Modern English has more vowels than Old English. There needs to be a way to represent those. [Modern English has a consonant doubling system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography#Marking_sound_changes_in_other_letters) to indicate short vowels. This [originally came from a very experimental era of English spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormulum#Orthography) that occured around the time that Runes were falling out of usage in England.

English runic spelling originally did not have doubled consonants. But then Latin letters came along and eventually people started to like doubling consonants to indicate short vowels. There are other reasons that Latin letters took over in England. But at least partially, they did represent a superior way of representing English sounds.

The idea is that if Runes had remained in use, they would have borrowed this consonant doubling concept from Latin spelling convention. 

The only other solution that alternative runic spelling systems have come up with for representing Modern English vowels is to use runes in ways that they were not intended to be used. Or to bring foreign runes into the Anglo Saxon futhorc.

The consonant doubling solution allows us to keep the original Anglo-Saxon futhorc while also acknowledging the natural development of English spelling through history.

## The runes

Here is a list of runes so that you can see how this system has kept them the same or changed them. The text is green if it is the same, orange if it slightly different, and red if it is a fairly large difference.

If we accept the doubled consonants changing the vowel sound before it, then the only real changes to research the reasonableness of are Double-Feoh, ᚣ, ᛠ, ᛟ, ᛇ, ᛉ, ᛡ, and ᚷ.

To go over these quickly:

- Double-Feoh is applying the same idea behind ᛣ to ᚠ
- The sound closest to original ᚣ (/y(ː)/) in modern English is in the way some English accents pronounce the MOUTH lexical set. So this rune takes that lexical set.
- ᛠ TODO
- ᛟ originally made a /ø/ sound in Old English. The closest sound to this in Modern English is the way that [some English accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) pronounce the NURSE lexical set. So this run takes that lexical set.
- ᛇ TODO
- Old English didn't have a known sound for ᛉ despite keeping it in their Rune rows. Going back to the Elder Futhark (consideration #3), this had a /z/ sound
- If we say that ᛡ went through metathesis and became /oj/, we can use this for the CHOICE, PRICE, and FACE lexical sets
- ᚷ TODO

Here is a list of [attested runic combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes#Combinations_and_digraphs) and their sound in Modern English Futhorc. Note that not all sounds would even make sense for Modern English:

| Combo | IPA       | Equivalent in Modern English Futhorc   |
|------------|-----------|--------------|--
| ᚩᛁ        | /oi/?     | <span style="color:orange"> ᚩᛡ   </span>   | 
| ᚷᚳ        | [gg]?, [dʒ]? | <span style="color:orange"> ᚷ </span> |
| ᚷᚷ        | ~[dʒ]     | <span style="color:orange"> ᚷ </span>   |
| ᚻᚹ        | /ʍ/       | <span style="color:green"> ᚻᚹ </span>     |
| ᚻᛋ        | /ks/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᚳᛋ  </span>     | 
| ᛇᛋ        | /ks/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᚳᛋ </span>  | 
| ᚾᚷ        | /ŋg/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᛝ or ᛝᚸ    </span>   |
| ᛁᚷ        | /ij/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᛁᛡ  </span>     | 
| ᛇᛡ?      | ~/ij/?    | <span style="color:orange"> ᛁᛡ  </span>    |
| ᛋᚳ        | /sk/, /ʃ/ | <span style="color:green"> ᛋᚳ   </span>    | 
| ᛖᚷ        | /ej/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᛖᛡ  </span>    | 
| ᛖᛇ       | ~/ej/, [eʝ]? | <span style="color:red"> ᛖᛡ </span> | 
| ᚪᚢ   | ~/ɑu/ | <span style="color:orange"> ᚣ </span><span style="color:green">(ᚪᚢ is possible if you want to be very specific about pronunciation)</span>  | 
| ᚪᛁ        | /ɑi/      | <span style="color:orange"> ᚪᛡ  </span>      | 
| ᚪᛡ        | /ɑj/?, /ɑx/? | <span style="color:green"> ᚪᛡ </span>| 

One thing that really stands out from this is that ᛡ seems to be an excellent compromise to rune combinations that involve both ᚷ and ᛁ. 

ᛁ + ᚷ = ᛡ

[Carnegie Mellon University did a study](https://thelanguagenerds.com/2019/most-common-sounds-in-spoken-english/) of the frequency of sounds in [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American_English) English. The list they came up with is the following:


| Phoneme     | Frequency | Rune |
| ----------- | --------- | ---- |
| ə (commA)   | 11.49% | ᛟ |
| n           | 7.11%  | ᚾ |
| r           | 6.94%  | ᚱ |
| t           | 6.91%  | ᛏ |
| ɪ (KIT)     | 6.32%  | ᛁ |
| s           | 4.75%  | ᛋ |
| d           | 4.21%  | ᛞ |
| l           | 3.96%  | ᛚ |
| i (FLEECE)  | 3.61%  | ᛁ |
| k           | 3.18%  | ᛣ |
| ð           | 2.95%  | ᚦ |

| m           | 2.76%  | ᛗ |
| z           | 2.76%  | ᛉ |
| p           | 2.15%  | ᛈ |
| æ (TRAP)    | 2.10%  | ᚫ |
| v           | 2.01%  | ᚠ |
| w           | 1.95%  | ᚹ |
| u (GOOSE)   | 1.93%  | ᚢ |
| b           | 1.80%  | ᛒ |
| e (FACE)    | 1.79%  | ᛖᛡ |
| ʌ (STRUT)   | 1.74%  | ᚪ |
| f           | 1.71%  | ᚠ |
| aɪ (PRICE)  | 1.50%  | ᚪᛡ |
| ɑ (PALM)    | 1.45%  | ᚪ |
| h           | 1.40%  | ᚻ |
| o (GOAT)    | 1.25%  | ᚩᚢ |
| ɒ (THOUGHT) | 1.18%  | ᚩ |
| ŋ           | 0.99%  | ᛝ |
| ʃ           | 0.97%  | ᛋᚳ |
| j           | 0.81%  | ᛄ |
| g           | 0.80%  | ᚸ |
| dʒ          | 0.59%  | ᚷ |
| tʃ          | 0.56%  | ᚳ |
| aʊ (MOUTH)  | 0.50%  | ᚣ |
| ʊ (FOOT)    | 0.43%  | ᚢ |
| θ           | 0.41%  | ᚦ |
| ɔɪ (CHOICE) | 0.10%  | ᚩᛡ |
| ʒ           | 0.07%  | ᛉᚳ |

The study was not done on any other accent of English. But if you wanted to make it more British, you could perhaps replace the PALM rune ᚪ with the LOT rune ᚩ instead. The data wouldn't be totally accurate, but it would be somewhat closer.

Now if we want to see just the individual frequency of runes, we need to split up digraphs and consider how one rune can have multiple sounds.

| Frequency | Rune |
| --------- | ---- |
| 11.49% | ᛟ |
| 9.93%  | ᛁ |
| 7.11%  | ᚾ |
| 6.94%  | ᚱ |
| 6.91%  | ᛏ |
| 5.72%  | ᛋ |
| 4.69%  | ᚪ |
| 4.65%  | ᛖ |
| 4.21%  | ᛞ |
| 3.96%  | ᛚ |
| 3.61%  | ᚢ |
| 3.39%  | ᛡ |
| 3.36%  | ᚦ |
| 3.18%  | ᛣ |
| 2.83%  | ᛉ |
| 2.76%  | ᛗ |
| 2.53%  | ᚩ |
| 2.15%  | ᛈ |
| 2.10%  | ᚫ |
| 2.01%  | ᚠ (double feoh) |
| 1.95%  | ᚹ |
| 1.80%  | ᛒ |
| 1.71%  | ᚠ |
| 1.60%  | ᚳ |
| 1.40%  | ᚻ |
| 0.99%  | ᛝ |
| 0.81%  | ᛄ |
| 0.80%  | ᚸ |
| 0.59%  | ᚷ |
| 0.50%  | ᚣ |

ᛟ and ᛁ are the most common vowels in Modern English Futhorc by far. 

Of the three vowel sisters ᚫᚪᚩ, Ac ᚪ will be the most frequent. I think this is appropriate since it is in between the other two. It represents both Ash ᚫ and Os ᚩ in itself. So it's the perfect representative. 

Ac ᚪ is also the first rune in terms of frequency that is unique to just the Anglo-Saxon runes. So if you're trying to determine which language is being written with some runes, you will likely notice ᚪ and know that it is English. ᛡ and ᛣ will be the next clues that you're reading English.

If you don't use "double feoh" for the /v/ sound, then ᚠ will be 3.72% right after Lagu ᛚ. If you do, then "double feoh" will be 2.01% and Feoh will be 1.71%.

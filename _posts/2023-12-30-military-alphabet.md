description: Names for Anglo-Saxon runes in situations that require extreme clarity

The following is a table of the current US Military Alphabet. After `Z` I have added the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc runes and some ideas for what could be their name in the Military Alphabet.

Note that this "military" alphabet name does not require a violent context. These are just names that are useful over a hard-to-hear communication channel; for situations when you need extra clarity and precision. Instead of saying "D as in Debbie, C as in Cat", you can just say "Delta, Charlie".

| Letter | Traditional Name | Military Name (1957-Present)    |

## The place of an alternative script alongside latin

It is highly likely that the Latin script will remain dominant in the English world for a long time. Afterall, the Latin script connects much of the world together! If English were to get rid of it entirely, it could do much damage in terms of being a major part of the connected world.

However, there can very well be a place for an alternative orthography alongside it. A script that is phonemic and thus rooted in how English actually sounds. This would be a truly useful tool for English speakers.

What kind of script would be accepted as an alternative spelling system? If it were entirely consistent and logical, a planned (artificial) script could be accepted, yes. But the [bike-shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) would never cease. Some would claim that only a few things are inconsistent while others would claim that a few inconsistencies are what is needed to emulate a natural script, etc.

This leaves us with an unplanned (natural) script. What sort of natural script would be accepted as an alternative spelling tool for English? It would have to be one that is rooted in the English language itself. English speakers would not accept using Cyrillic or Georgian or Devanagari. This leaves us with Runes.

Runes are capable of providing the same phonemic spelling benefits as Shavian, with none of the complaints of inconsistencies or illogicality. Latin orthography could remain the Orthodox and Traditional spelling while Runes are a more clear speech-to-writing system that is accessible and efficient for the people. This was essentially the place of [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Creation) amongst the Koreans for about 400 years!

But wait! Hangul is a planned (artificial) script just like Shavian! That is true. But Hangul is also consistent (unlike Shavian), and it had the backing of the government. At one point, it was also intrinsically tied with Korean Nationalism. Even if Shavian was perfectly consistent, and if one English speaking government adopted and promoted it, that doesn't mean that the rest of the English world would follow suit. There is no longer one, single English identity like there is a Korean identity.

For the whole English world, the only way to get to a single English identity is to go back in time and recover what we have lost. A point in time when the English world was smaller. Take that and move forward into the future.

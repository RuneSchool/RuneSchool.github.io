count number of strokes for words in runes vs words in chinese.

Runes are harder to write by hand compared to shavian. 

Is that a bad thing?


1. Nowadays handwriting isn't popular. chinese and korean is harder to handwrite as well
2. handwriting becomes more special
3. maybe writing in the physical world should require more effort

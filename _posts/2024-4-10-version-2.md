description: Update to the spelling system

Rune School is breaking away from the original spelling system and updating it based on their own experience and learnings.

A couple of things inspired this:

1. A reddit comment about how doubled vowels are attested in the futhorc corpus

2. A student complaint about the word unknown in runes: ᚪᚾᚾᚾᚩᚢᚾ

I had been playing around with my own changes to the spelling system for a long time, but I wasn't ready to show anything yet.

The goals of the spelling changes are twofold.

1. Align vowels to better match the transcriptions [explained by Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA)

2. Drastically reduce the amount of doubling of runes

# Lindsey Vowels

What I call the "Lindsey Vowels" are below:

![](images/LindseyVowels.png)

You can see a similar chart in Labov's Atlas of North American English. Dr Geoff Lindsey did not invent this organization of vowels.

You can see that the overall grouping of vowels is short vowels (red), "linking r" or lengthened vowels (yellow), and glide vowels (sea green).

Based on this grouping, I have created my own to suit our needs a bit better.

You can see that I have tried to show a bit more cleanly not just the groupings of vowels, but also the relationships *across* groupings. This allows us to use the same runes across the groupings in predictable ways that will feel intuitive to the user.

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   | ᛁᛁ / ᛁᚱ NEAR                    | ᛁᛡ FLEECE |           |
|         | ᚪ / ᚪᚱ PALM           | ᚪᛡ PRICE  | ᚪᚹ MOUTH  |
| ᛖ DRESS | ᛖᛖ / ᛖᚱ SQUARE                  | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT / ᚩᚱ NORTH        | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT / ᚩᚹᚱ FORCE  |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT / ᚢᚱ CURE        |           | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |
| ᚫ LAD  |  ᚫᚫ BAD                    |           |           |
| ᛟ commA | ᛟᛟ / ᛟᚱ NURSE                  |           |

Now these are the intuitive spellings for these vowels. See the consistent themes? Long vowels are doubled, unless followed by an R. And glides consistently get the /j/ or /w/ applied to the "main" (short) vowel rune.

There are some shortcut runes that we may want to use like so:

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   | **ᛠ / ᛠᚱ NEAR**                    | **ᛇ FLEECE** |           |
|         | ᚪ / ᚪᚱ PALM           | ᚪᛡ PRICE  | **ᚣ MOUTH**  |
| ᛖ DRESS | ᛖᛖ / ᛖᚱ SQUARE                  | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT / ᚩᚱ NORTH        | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT / ᚩᚹᚱ FORCE  |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT / ᚢᚱ CURE        |           | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |
| ᚫ LAD  |  ᚫᚫ BAD                    |           |           |
| ᛟ commA | ᛟᛟ / ᛟᚱ NURSE                  |           |

# Changes

## Remove consonant doubling

Consonant doubling wasn't working. English has short vowels far more frequently than lengthened vowels and thus the doubled consonants were too frequent.

On top of that, there were so many consonants that potentially needed to be doubled, it was very inefficient.

## Introduce vowel doubling

Vowel doubling is done to indicate a lengthened vowel, which is fairly rare in English. 

*Vowels do not need to be doubled if they are followed by a Rad.*

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOT | ᛚᚩᛏᛏ | ᛚᚩᛏ |
| THOUGHT | ᚦᚩᛏ | ᚦᚩᚩᛏ |
| NORTH | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ 🇺🇸 / ᚾᚩᚩᚦ 🇬🇧|
| SQUARE | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ 🇺🇸 / ᛋᛣᚹᛖᛖ 🇬🇧|

Compare doubling (maybe) 4 vowels vs doubling 16 consonants.

## FLEECE is spelled with ᛁᛡ

To make the spelling more aligned to the Lindsey-inspired vowel chart, we analyze FLEECE as /ij/ (KIT + /j/). The final /j/ is felt more strongly in words like "fleeing" and less strongly when it is the final sound on a word like in "ski".

Alternatively, we can spell FLEECE with ᛇ.

## STRUT is spelled with ᚢ

While foreigners may pronounce STRUT with a PALM phoneme, the PALM phoneme has no real connection to the STRUT phoneme at all. English natives would never connect PALM to STRUT, so a spelling system should cater to what native speakers find natural.

## ᚣ is an optional rune for /jʊ/

The ᚣ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. This sounds is only present in [some dialects today for the word "few"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence). Because of this, this rune will be an optional way to spell words like "new", "few", "dune", etc. Although it may make more sense to simply spell these words as yod+ur.

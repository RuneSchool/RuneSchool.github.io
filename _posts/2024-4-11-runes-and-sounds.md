The goal for this analysis and further spelling systems is to be true and authentic to the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. We do not add in foreign runes or wildly change rune sounds.

# The Runes

Before we can design a spelling system, we need to understand what we're working with.

Let's get a good look at them with some cool ASCII arrangements.

Extra runes separate:

## Assigning sounds

In order to use these runes, we needs to take their original sounds and apply them to sounds that exist in modern English.

Here is a list of runes so that you can see how this system has kept them the same or changed them. The text is green if it is the same, orange if it slightly different, and red if it is a fairly large difference.

The only real changes to address are Double-Feoh, ᚢ, ᛠ, ᛉ, and ᚷ.

### ᛉ 

Old English didn't have a known sound for ᛉ despite keeping it in their rune rows. Some think that it made the sound of /ks/ like the latin "x", but it is unsure. Going back to the Elder Futhark, this had a /z/ sound, so we just keep that sound.

### ᚢ 

STRUT originally came from the "short u" sound. Because of this, it's appropriate to think that if runes had continued in use, people would have eventually started to pronounce ᚢ as a STRUT. 

### ᛠ 

[In Old English, the word "ear" was pronounced like /ˈæ͜ɑː.re/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eare#Old_English), which would have used this rune. Over time, this word "ear" began to sound like /ɪə/. This is partially documented in the Great Vowel Shift where words with "ea" eventually began to sound like words with "ee". There are some people today who [pronounce NEAR like /ɛə̯/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/19-near-lexical-set/#mergers) which also shows a bit of a remnant that still pronounces "ear" closer to how it used to be said. So we can assign this rune to the NEAR lexical set, where the pronunciation has mostly shifted from /æːɑ/ to /iːə/.  

### ᚷ 

The original sound of ᚷ was /j/, but when French began to influence English after the Norman invasion (~1100), /j/ started to become /dʒ/ in English, [just like in French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_French#To_Early_Old_French[when?]) (Think of how the word Jehovah or Jesus changed in pronunciation over time). So also taking into account that ᛄ is already /j/, we can reduce historical ᚷᚷ to just ᚷ for /dʒ/.

### Double-Feoh

Double-Feoh is applying the same idea behind ᚳ and ᛣ to ᚠ.

ᚳ could previously be two sounds "ch" or "k". Its doubled cousin ᛣ takes one of those sounds "k".

Similarly ᚠ can be two sounds "f" or "v". Its doubled cousin will take one of those sounds "v".

# Phonetic or Phonemic?

The runes can't just be assigned to very specific IPA symbols. That would mean that we are mandating that everyone pronounce a rune in exactly the same way. There needs to be some flexibility in order for the runes to be useful. Because of that, we need to map out a range of valid pronunciations for each rune. That range of pronunciations is called a phoneme.

A phonemic script ensures that no matter how an accent shifts sounds around, the words will still be understandable around the world.

The consonants are pretty straightforward. There is little variation within those. So we will focus on the vowels.

## IPA vowel chart

The IPA vowel chart gives us a lay of the land in terms of where phonetic sounds live. We can use this as a map of sounds to mark out locations of phonemes (ranges of valid pronunciations).

Using the above table, we can assign the vowel runes to these rough territories.

![IPA vowel map](/assets/images/runeSchool2IPAmapNoSchwa.png)

Each circle is saying "your pronunciation of this rune is somewhere in here".

From here, we can make adjustments to the territorial boundaries in order to develop spelling *systems*. A map of where each vowel rune lives on the IPA vowel chart is not enough to help people use the runes to spell. Users need to understand guidelines for how to treat various lexical sets of words.

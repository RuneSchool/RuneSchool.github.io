description: The reasoning behind the choices made in Rune School's Modern English Futhorc system

The [newly revamped](/version-2/) Rune School offers both a [spelling standard](#spelling-standard) and a [toolkit](#toolkit) for *making* spelling standards.

# Toolkit

The toolkit exists to provide a common set of patterns that any user will find intuitive no matter what spelling system someone is using.

First, we map runes to ranges of pronunciations.

Then we apply lexical set ranges on top of that map. 

![Lexical Sets chart](/assets/images/RuneSchoolLexicalSets.png)

Notice all of the empty spots on the chart. Some of the empty spots don't have a current, existing English phoneme, but they may in the future. Some of the empty spots are possible alternative spellings for slightly different phoneme variations. Think of the toolkit as a playground. Within the confines of these patterns, you can have fun.

For example, you may wish to use ᛟᚹ for your GOAT set, or you may wish to use ᛖᛄᚱ (FACE+R) for your SQUARE set. Go ahead and fill in the blanks to see what you can come up with!

The [spelling standard](#spelling-standard) that we use at Rune School is designed to be as globally neutral as possible. Think of it as the way you may want to spell if you had a newspaper that reached the whole world.

## Assigning sounds to Runes

Here is a list of runes so that you can see how this system has kept them the same or changed them. The text is green if it is the same, orange if it slightly different, and red if it is a fairly large difference.

The only real changes to address are Double-Feoh, [ᚣ](version-2/#ᚣ-for-foot), ᛠ, ᛉ, [ᛡ](version-2/#ᛡ-for-happy-vowel), and ᚷ.

| Rune | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ᛉ | Old English didn't have a known sound for ᛉ despite keeping it in their rune rows. Some think that it made the sound of /ks/ like the latin "x", but it is unsure. Going back to the Elder Futhark, this had a /z/ sound, so we just keep that sound. |
| ᚷ | The original sound of ᚷ was /j/, but when French began to influence English after the Norman invasion (~1100), /j/ started to become /dʒ/ in English, [just like in French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_French#To_Early_Old_French[when?]) (Think of how the word Jehovah or Jesus changed in pronunciation over time). So also taking into account that ᛄ is already /j/, we can reduce historical ᚷᚷ to just ᚷ for /dʒ/. |
| ᛠ | [In Old English, the word "ear" was pronounced like /ˈæ͜ɑː.re/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eare#Old_English), which would have used this rune. Over time, this word "ear" began to sound like /ɪə/. This is partially documented in the Great Vowel Shift where words with "ea" eventually began to sound like words with "ee". There are some people today who [pronounce NEAR like /ɛə̯/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/19-near-lexical-set/#mergers) which also shows a bit of a remnant that still pronounces "ear" closer to how it used to be said. So we can assign this rune to the NEAR lexical set, where the pronunciation has mostly shifted from /æːɑ/ to /iːə/.  |
| Double-Feoh | Double-Feoh is applying the same idea behind ᚳ and ᛣ to ᚠ |


# Spelling Standard

Based on the [toolkit](#toolkit) above, we choose our lexical sets that we want to exist in our spelling standard. Then we simplify it all by removing the empty sets. After removing empty sets, we remove unnecessary rune doubling and add in any shortcut runes.

![Spelling Standard Lexical Sets](/assets/images/RuneSchoolLexicalSets-Simplified.png)

## Vowel reduction

Only use ᛟ when there is no other option.

> [So the standard transcription of the reduced vowel contrast is justified, but the widespread use of [ə] to transcribe word-internal reduced vowels is misleading — mid reduced vowels are generally only found in stem-final position.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44526449)

More often than not, if a diphthong is being reduced, you can just remove the glide.

Eg. ᚠᛖᛚᚢᚹ -> ᚠᛖᛚᚢ, ᛏᚣᚹ -> ᛏᚣ, ᚦᛁᛄ -> ᚦᛁ

Do not immedietely jump to using a ᛟ

## Shavian Readlex

When in doubt, follow the [ReadLex](https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com/spellingprinciples/).

Where we divurge is in the following

### Allophonic /i/ is ·𐑦

We use the rune ᛡ for the happY vowel

### Allophonic /u/ is ·𐑫

Use ᚣᚹ. Eg. "actual" is ᚫᛣᚳᚣᚹᛚ. The w+L together add an inherent schwa.

If reduction happens as in "today", the glide is dropped. Eg. ᛏᚣᚹᛞᛖᛄ -> ᛏᚣᛞᛖᛄ

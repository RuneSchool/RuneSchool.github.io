The [newly revamped](/version-2/) Rune School offers both a [spelling standard](#spelling-standard) and a [toolkit](#toolkit) for *making* spelling standards.

# Toolkit

The toolkit exists to provide a common set of patterns that any user will find intuitive no matter what spelling system someone is using.

First, we map runes to ranges of pronunciations.

![IPA vowels map](/assets/images/runeSchool2IPAmap.png)

Since the whole chart is covered, this gives us our base vowels. Next we apply consistent patterns onto them to create our lexical sets.

![Lexical Sets chart](/assets/images/RuneSchoolLexicalSets.png)

Notice all of the empty spots on the chart. Some of the empty spots don't have a current, existing English phoneme, but they may in the future. Some of the empty spots are possible alternative spellings for slightly different phoneme variations. Think of the toolkit as a playground. Within the confines of these patterns, you can have fun.

For example, you may wish to use ᛟᚹ for your GOAT set, use ᛖᛄᚱ (FACE+R) for your SQUARE set, or even move your NURSE set down to ᚢᚢᚱ. Go ahead and fill in the blanks.

The [spelling standard](#spelling-standard) that we use at Rune School is designed to be as globally neutral as possible. Think of it as the way you may want to spell if you had a newspaper that reached the whole world.

## Assigning sounds to Runes

Here is a list of runes so that you can see how this system has kept them the same or changed them. The text is green if it is the same, orange if it slightly different, and red if it is a fairly large difference.

The only real changes to address are Double-Feoh, [ᚣ](/version-2/#ᚣ-for-foot), ᛠ, ᛉ, [ᛡ](/version-2/#ᛡ-for-happy-vowel), and ᚷ.

| Rune | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ᛉ | Old English didn't have a known sound for ᛉ despite keeping it in their rune rows. Some think that it made the sound of /ks/ like the latin "x", but it is unsure. Going back to the Elder Futhark, this had a /z/ sound, so we just keep that sound. |
| ᚷ | The original sound of ᚷ was /j/, but when French began to influence English after the Norman invasion (~1100), /j/ started to become /dʒ/ in English, [just like in French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_French#To_Early_Old_French[when?]) (Think of how the word Jehovah or Jesus changed in pronunciation over time). So also taking into account that ᛄ is already /j/, we can reduce historical ᚷᚷ to just ᚷ for /dʒ/. |
| ᛠ | [In Old English, the word "ear" was pronounced like /ˈæ͜ɑː.re/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eare#Old_English), which would have used this rune. Over time, this word "ear" began to sound like /ɪə/. This is partially documented in the Great Vowel Shift where words with "ea" eventually began to sound like words with "ee". There are some people today who [pronounce NEAR like /ɛə̯/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/19-near-lexical-set/#mergers) which also shows a bit of a remnant that still pronounces "ear" closer to how it used to be said. So we can assign this rune to the NEAR lexical set, where the pronunciation has mostly shifted from /æːɑ/ to /iːə/.  |
| Double-Feoh | Double-Feoh is applying the same idea behind ᚳ and ᛣ to ᚠ |


# Spelling Standard

Based on the [toolkit](#toolkit) above, we choose our lexical sets that we want to exist in our spelling standard. Then we simplify it all by removing the empty sets. After removing empty sets, we remove unnecessary rune doubling and add in any shortcut runes.

*Note*: You are free to not use this spelling standard or to modify it according to your needs. Please do visit the [Rune School Discord server](https://discord.gg/BThW4fxAwN) if you have questions or suggestions.

## Shavian Readlex

When in doubt, follow the [ReadLex](https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com/spellingprinciples/).

Where we divurge is in the following:

### happY vowel

We use the rune ᛡ for the happY vowel. And for the weak vowel in "roses", we allow for KIT instead of commA.

| Latin | Readlex (Shavian) | Rune School |

| parted | 𐑐𐑸𐑑𐑩𐑛  | ᛈᚪᚱᛏᛁᛞ or ᛈᚪᚱᛏᛟᛞ |
| partied | 𐑐𐑸𐑑𐑦𐑛 | ᛈᚪᚱᛏᛡᛞ |
| roses | 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟  | ᚱᚢᚹᛉᛁᛉ or ᚱᚢᚹᛉᛟᛉ |
| Rosie’s | ·𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑦𐑟 | ᚱᚢᚹᛉᛡᛉ |
| trusty | 𐑑𐑮𐑳𐑕𐑑𐑦  | ᛏᚱᚢᛋᛏᛡ |
| trustee | 𐑑𐑮𐑳𐑕𐑑𐑰 | ᛏᚱᚢᛋᛏᛇ |
| candid | 𐑑𐑮𐑳𐑕𐑑𐑰 | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞ |
| candied | 𐑑𐑮𐑳𐑕𐑑𐑰 | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛡᛞ |
| candide | 𐑑𐑮𐑳𐑕𐑑𐑰 | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛇᛞ |

### Allophonic /u/

Use ᚣᚹ. Eg. "actual" is ᚫᛣᚳᚣᚹᛚ. The w+L together add an inherent schwa.

### Syllabic consonants

Write just ᚱ, ᛚ, ᛗ, or ᚾ where you see 𐑼 or 𐑩𐑤, 𐑩𐑯, or 𐑩𐑥.

In most places you see **𐑼** or **𐑩𐑤**, it is because there is a glide right before it. We write the glides, so we don't need to explicitly include the schwas. Only write ᛟᚱ if it represents the suffix -er, or similar.

In many (not all) places where you see **𐑩𐑯** or **𐑩𐑥**, you can just right the ᛗ or ᚾ directly without the schwa needed.

### Shortcut words

| Latin | Shavian | Runes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| the | 𐑞 | ᚦ |
| to | 𐑑 | ᛏ |
| and | 𐑯 | ᚾ |
| for | 𐑓 | ᚠᚱ |
| of | 𐑝 | ᚠ |

### Vowel reduction

The range of pronunciation for all vowel runes has a bit that reaches into the center where ᛟ lives.

So in many cases when a vowel is being "reduced", it may just be sliding closer to the center part of its range of possible pronunciations because of a change in rhythm (prosody) of speech.

<!-- The ReadLex swaps a vowel to schwa very often, but we would just temper that habit a bit.

Only use ᛟ when there is no other option, because swapping a vowel rune entirely may hurt recognizablity of some words. Consider the importance of maintaining visual similarity between word derivations and shortenings.-->

More often than not, if a diphthong is being reduced, you can just remove the glide.

description: An explanation of the Rune School spelling system for Modern English Futhorc
hidden: false
---

The Rune School Spelling System is inspired by [Shavian](https://shavian.info), [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online), [Lexical Sets for Actors](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/introduction-2/), and [Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/@DrGeoffLindsey).

You can think of it as a runic Shavian with a few improvements like:

* letter design is historically rooted
* flexibility to seamlessly add or subtract phonemes as the user wishes
* transparently shows the relationships between phonemes with consistent use of combinatorial patterns
* a letter for the happY vowel

# System

Based on the data from the [runes and their sounds](/runes-and-sounds/) and the info from [Dr. Lindsey's IPA symbols](/version-2/#lindsey-vowels), we can create a spelling system.

In parenthesis you can see the "shortcut" runes. 

Below is the fully condensed and simplfied system.

The Rune School Spelling System is pretty much a point for point recreation of the [Shavian ReadLex Spelling Standard](https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com/spellingprinciples/).

The idea is that you can use the ReadLex dictionary and swap Shavian out for runes.

See a mapping of the vowels below:

# Differences from ReadLex

## happY vowel

Use the happY rune ᛡ where Shavian would have a trailing 𐑦.

## Syllabic consonants

Often times, you can write just ᚱ, ᛚ, ᛗ, or ᚾ where you see 𐑼 or 𐑩𐑤, 𐑩𐑯, or 𐑩𐑥.

In most places you see **𐑼** or **𐑩𐑤**, it is because there is a glide right before it. We write the glides, so we don't need to explicitly include the schwas. Only write ᛟᚱ if it represents the suffix -er, or similar.

In many (not all) places where you see **𐑩𐑯** or **𐑩𐑥**, you can just right the ᛗ or ᚾ directly without the schwa needed.

When in doubt, consider the derivatives. 

For example, consider "Terrible". Can it be spelled ᛏᛖᚱᛟᛒᛚ without a schwa before the L? If we can spell the derivative "Terribly" by just adding the -y on the end, then yes! ᛏᛖᚱᛟᛒᛚᛡ (it works!)

Another example, consider "Imagine". Can it be spelled ᛁᛗᚫᚷᚾ without a schwa before the N? If we can spell the derivative "Imagination" by just adding the -ation on the end, then yes! ᛁᛗᚫᚷᚾᛖᛄᛋᚳᚾ. It fails because the syllable boundaries break. It needs to be ᛁᛗᚫᚷᛟᚾᛖᛄᛋᚳᚾ for it to sound right, and thus the base word should be ᛁᛗᚫᚷᛟᚾ.

## Shortcut words

| Latin | Shavian | Runes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| the | 𐑞 | ᚦ |
| to | 𐑑 | ᛏ |
| and | 𐑯 | ᚾ |
| for | 𐑓 | ᚠᚱ |
| of | 𐑝 | ᚠ |

# Choices

## ᛟ for commA

You can see on the IPA vowel chart that ᛟ was traditionally more fronted than a commA sound typically is.

![IPA vowel map](/assets/images/runeSchool2IPAmapNoSchwa.png)

The original sound of ᛟ is still used for the NURSE vowel in some accents. NURSE is often very closely related to lettER, which is also closely related to commA. So whatever rune we use for NURSE should also be used for commA.

Because of this, we have pushed the acceptable range of this rune into ᚢ's territory and ᚢ has retreated towards the back.

## ᛟᛟᚱ for NURSE

Previously, the system used ᛟᚱ for both lettER and NURSE. As an American, I am totally fine with this. But I know that many English speakers have a strong distinction between these two phonemes. 

Based on the principles shown at the top of this page, it only makes sense to allow for a doubled ᛟᛟ. This brings our system more aligned to the phonemic distinctions that Shavian allows.

Think of it this way:

> Merry ᛖᚱ is to SQUARE ᛖᛖᚱ as lettER ᛟᚱ is to NURSE ᛟᛟᚱ

## ᚢ for STRUT

STRUT originally came from the "short u" sound. Because of this, it's appropriate to think that if runes had continued in use, people would have eventually started to pronounce ᚢ as a STRUT.

Examples:

| Latin | Runes  |
| --- | --- |
| putt | ᛈᚢᛏ |
| put |  ᛈᚣᛏ  |
| pool | ᛈᚣᚹᛚ |
| pull |  ᛈᚣᛚ |
| boom |ᛒᚣᚹᛗ |
| bum | ᛒᚢᛗ |

For more info on FOOT ᚣ, see below.

## ᚩᚹ for GOAT

Because FORCE is very much related to NORTH, it makes sense that the nucleus of FORCE (GOAT) would also be related to the nucleus of NORTH (THOUGHT).

THOUGHT (ᚩᚩ) is to NORTH (ᚩᚩᚱ) as GOAT (ᚩᚹ) is to FORCE (ᚩᚹᚱ)

Since we merge NORTH and FORCE in most English accents, we should have the two nucleuses the same.

There are a number of accents that make GOAT a monophthong like /o:/ as well. In which case having the visual similarity of ᚩᚩ and ᚩᚹ is good. There is also the historic relationship of GOAT ᚩᚹ being the strong form of LOT ᚩ. 

If you have a more british accent with a clear ᛟᚹ type of pronunciation of GOAT, you can think of GOAT/HOLY being ᛟᚹ and GOAL/WHOLLY being ᚩᚹ. In which case we are just merging HOLY into WHOLLY. 

While Dr Lindsey makes many [great points about words like "halloween" and "Iowa" being ᛟᚹ](https://www.englishspeechservices.com/blog/the-spooky-ambiguity-of-halloween/), he also brings up a number of points of ambiguity such as "away" vs "oasis". We can't show stress very effectively with runes and a choice needs to be made on how to represent this phoneme. For the time being, we are just teaching that ᚩᚹ and ᛟᚹ are cousins, but ᛟᚹ doesn't come around very often.

<!--
## ᚢᚹ for GOAT

ethel used to be related to /o:/ in elder futhark, and GOAT is monophthongized to /o:/ so therefore using it for this GOAT set brings it back home.

It's no secret that GOAT can have a wide range of starting points. But when we consider the possible range of pronunciations for STRUT 

![possible pronunciations for STRUT](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/1860/2022/05/STRUT_Lexical_Set_2.png)

and the possible range of starting points for GOAT, 

![possible pronunciations for GOAT](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/1860/2022/05/GOAT_Lexical_Set_2.png)

they are a very good match.

It's true that when GOAT is monophthongized, it tends to be closer to the THOUGHT vowel. Consider though that many pronunciations of ᚢ (STRUT) are just unrounded versions of THOUGHT. So it's not a difficult stretch to say that ᚢ + ᚹ together would make such a sound. The lips round during the off-glide anyway.

There are also some pronunciations of GOAT that involve a FOOT or GOOSE sound. ᚢ being the cousin of ᚣ makes perfect sense for this (more on ᚣ below).

The hull-hole merger feels right at home with this orthography as well. 

ᚢ is just the best middle-ground between the RP style schwa (ᛟ for us) starting point and the GA style ᚩ.

ᚩᚹ will remain a valid orthography for the GOAL lexical set; for when people want to be exact. People may choose to write names with this phoneme, for example. But for the most part, we will recommend that GOAL is subsumed into the GOAT set with ᚢᚹ.

ᚢ also just so happens to not have a lot going on in this system, so this makes the rune a bit more commonplace.

## ᚣ for FOOT

This rune visually looks like ᛁ inside of ᚢ and would thus be appropriate for any of the sounds between /i/ and /u/ on the IPA sound chart.

The ᚣ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. It's hard to find a modern day correlate to this sound. But let's look at the data:

| Sound similar to /y/ | Dialects using it for FOOT | Dialects using it for GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 0 | 4 |
| [[ʉ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 5 | 6 |
| [[ɨ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 2 | 1 |
| [[ʏ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 4 | 2 |

So out of the similar sounds, 12 dialects are using it for the GOOSE phoneme and 11 are using it for the FOOT phoneme. It's almost equal! So here are our options:

| Option | STRUT | FOOT | GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 2 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚣ | 
| 3 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 4 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚣᚹ | 

Another option entirely would be to use ᚣ as a rune that represents /ju:/ like in the word "new". The downside of this is that the "yod" is coalesced to the consonant *before* and **not** to the vowel /u:/. So if the yod is written at all, it would make more sense to be thought of as belonging with the previous consonant, not combined with /u:/.

Option 4 is the best because of the STRUT-FOOT (hull-pull) merger and the FOOT-GOOSE merger. *Visually* STRUT and FOOT look similar and *also* FOOT and GOOSE look similar. So FOOT is the meeting point of the two. Also, STRUT is a more open sound than FOOT on the IPA vowel chart and ᚢ looks more visually open than ᚣ.

## ᛇ for FLEECE

Previously, ᛇ was used for "rad*io*" and "g*eo*graphy" as well as the consonant sound in "lo*ch*". We are keeping the consonant sound the same. However, the vowel sound for this rune was more likely [ji(ː)] or [i(ː)j]. We are representing the FLEECE phoneme as /ij/ and as such, this is the perfect shortcut rune for that sound.

| Latin | Runes  |
| --- |  --- |
| radio | ᚱᛖᛄᛞᛡᚩᚹ |
| geography |  ᚷᛡᚩᚸᚱᛟᚠᛡ |
| fleece | ᚠᛚᛇᛋ |

Users may represent FLEECE as either ᛁᛄ or ᛇ.

## ᛡ for happY vowel

> [happY can be associated with either fleece, kit, or face, with vowel qualities in the range of /i ~ ɪ ~ e ~ ɛ/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/25-happy-lexical-set/)"

The sound in happY could be either KIT or FLEECE, or something different all together. If anyone has used Shavian before, you know the pain of not having a letter just for this happY phoneme. So the happY vowel is now represented with ᛡ. 

ᛄ and ᛡ are famously controversial. Many believe that they are two different styles for the same rune. But the fact is that multiple manuscripts contain both of these runes and they even have different names. So at least one person out there thought the difference was significant enough to warrant two different runes with their own stanzas. That is good enough for me to respect.

ᛡ was called "Īor", probably meaning "eel". ᛄ was called "Gēr", meaning "year". 

If we take each of these runes sounds as being the first phoneme of their names, then ᛡ has an /i/-ish sound and ᛄ has a /j/-ish sound.

The /i/-ish sound is perfect for the happY vowel. And moving ᛄ to the FACE, PRICE, and CHOICE phonemes will make it consistent with the usage of ᚹ in this same regard.

| Latin       | Runes  |
| ----------- |  --------- |
| Kale        |  ᛣᛖᛄᛚ      |
| Kyle        |  ᛣᚫᛄᛚ      |
| Coil        |  ᛣᚩᛄᛚ      |
| Geography   |  ᚷᛡᚩᚸᚱᛟᚠᛡ  |
| Radio       |  ᚱᛖᛄᛞᛡᚩᚹ   |
| Kitty       |  ᛣᛁᛏᛡ      |
| Create      |  ᚳᚱᛡᛖᛄᛏ    |
| Easily (1)  |  ᛁᛄᛉᛁᛚᛡ     |
| Easily (2)  | ᛇᛉᛁᛚᛡ    |
| Yield (1)   |  ᛄᛁᛄᛚᛞ     |
| Yield (2)   |  ᛄᛇᛚᛞ      |
| Reality   |  ᚱᛡᚫᛚᛁᛏᛡ      |
| Candied     | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛡᛞ    |
| Candidly    |  ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞᛚᛡ  |
| Candide (1) |  ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛄᛞ    |
| Candide (2) |  ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛇᛞ   |

Ultimately, if a user confuses these two runes and uses just one for happY and /j/, it's not the end of the world. But offering this distinction should aid in clarity.

It can also be noted that if bindrunes become widely available, bindrunes of ᛖᛡ ᚫᛡ ᚩᛡ could be used which would distinguish diphthongs from the happY vowel, if someone should want to only use ᛡ and not ᛄ.

## ᚪ as a shortcut for ᚫᚫ

Traditionally, you will often see things like /æɪ/ in that old dictionaries for the pronunciation of PRICE. This is because historically TRAP has always been thought of as a short PALM. Think of how a boston person says “spa”. They say it with a long TRAP sound. Think of how Irish people say START. They say it very obviously like ᛋᛏᚫᚫᚱᛏ (a long TRAP sound).

And then we consider the internal logic of the doubled runes. Doubled vowels bring the sound a bit closer to the center of the IPA chart. Doubling ash brings it more in the middle where SPA is.

Also consider the variability of words in the BATH lexical set. Some go to TRAP and some go to PALM. This is to say that some say the words with a long TRAP sound (PALM) and some with a regular TRAP sound.

And consider the design of the look of the runes. It makes sense that ᚫ and ᚩ are the primary ones. Both fully realized runes. Then ak develops as a sort of in between rune ᚪ.

And finally, consider that this is better for crosswords and other word games. More utility with less letters (if you exclude shortcut runes).

In a hundred years if there is a meaningful split within PALM or TRAP, that will be workable with this system. I doubt that such a thing would occur within 500 years at least, but if it happens, we would just say “ᚪ rune grew up and earned its own row in the table!”

# What about my accent?

## Don't have the FACE merger

If you don't have the FACE merger and instead have two distinct lexical sets of PANE and PAIN, I would suggest that you use a bindrune of ᛖ‍ᛄ for the PANE set to indicate that it is a closer monophthong and an unbound combination of ᛖᛄ for PAIN to indicate that it is the full diphthong.

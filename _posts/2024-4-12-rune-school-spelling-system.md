The Rune School Spelling System is inspired by [Shavian](https://shavian.info), [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online), [Lexical Sets for Actors](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/introduction-2/), and [Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/@DrGeoffLindsey).

# System

Based on the data from the [runes and their sounds](/runes-and-sounds/) and the info from [Dr. Lindsey's IPA symbols](/version-2/#lindsey-vowels), we can create a spelling system.

Below is the fully condensed and simplfied system.

# Choices

## ᛟ for commA

You can see on the IPA vowel chart that ᛟ was traditionally more fronted than a commA sound typically is.

We have pushed the acceptable range of this rune into ᚢ's territory and ᚢ has retreated towards the back.

## ᛟᛟᚱ for NURSE

It just so happens that the original sound of ᛟ is still used for the NURSE vowel in some accents.

Previously, the system used ᛟᚱ for both lettER and NURSE. As an American, I am totally fine with this. But I know that many English speakers have a strong distinction between these two phonemes. 

Based on the principles shown at the top of this page, it only makes sense to allow for a doubled ᛟᛟ. This brings our system more aligned to the phonemic distinctions that Shavian allows.

Think of it this way:

> Merry ᛖᚱ is to SQUARE ᛖᛖᚱ as lettER ᛟᚱ is to NURSE ᛟᛟᚱ

## ᚢ for STRUT

While foreigners may pronounce STRUT with a PALM phoneme, the PALM phoneme has no historical connection to the STRUT phoneme at all. Because of this English natives would never connect PALM to STRUT in their minds. A spelling system should cater to what native speakers find natural, not foreign learners.

STRUT originally came from the "short u" sound. Because of this, it's appropriate to think that if runes had continued in use, people would have eventually started to pronounce ᚢ as a STRUT.

Examples:

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| putt | ᛈᚪᛏᛏ | ᛈᚢᛏ |
| put | ᛈᚢᛏᛏ  | ᛈᚣᛏ  |
| pool | ᛈᚢᛚ | ᛈᚣᚹᛚ |
| pull | ᛈᚢᛚᛚ | ᛈᚣᛚ |
| boom | ᛒᚢᛗ | ᛒᚣᚹᛗ |
| bum | ᛒᚪᛗᛗ | ᛒᚢᛗ |

For more info on FOOT ᚣ, see below.

## ᚢᚹ for GOAT

ethel used to be related to /o:/ in elder futhark, and GOAT is monophthongized to /o:/ so therefore using it for this GOAT set brings it back home.

It's no secret that GOAT can have a wide range of starting points. But when we consider the possible range of pronunciations for STRUT 

![possible pronunciations for STRUT](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/1860/2022/05/STRUT_Lexical_Set_2.png)

and the possible range of starting points for GOAT, 

![possible pronunciations for GOAT](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/1860/2022/05/GOAT_Lexical_Set_2.png)

they are a very good match.

It's true that when GOAT is monophthongized, it tends to be closer to the THOUGHT vowel. Consider though that many pronunciations of ᚢ (STRUT) are just unrounded versions of THOUGHT. So it's not a difficult stretch to say that ᚢ + ᚹ together would make such a sound. The lips round during the off-glide anyway.

There are also some pronunciations of GOAT that involve a FOOT or GOOSE sound. ᚢ being the cousin of ᚣ makes perfect sense for this (more on ᚣ below).

The hull-hole merger feels right at home with this orthography as well. 

ᚢ is just the best middle-ground between the RP style schwa (ᛟ for us) starting point and the GA style ᚩ.

ᚩᚹ will remain a valid orthography for the GOAL lexical set; for when people want to be exact. People may choose to write names with this phoneme, for example. But for the most part, we will recommend that GOAL is subsumed into the GOAT set with ᚢᚹ.

ᚢ also just so happens to not have a lot going on in this system, so this makes the rune a bit more commonplace.

## ᚣ for FOOT

This rune visually looks like ᛁ inside of ᚢ and would thus be appropriate for any of the sounds between /i/ and /u/ on the IPA sound chart.

The ᚣ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. It's hard to find a modern day correlate to this sound. But let's look at the data:

| Sound similar to /y/ | Dialects using it for FOOT | Dialects using it for GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 0 | 4 |
| [[ʉ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 5 | 6 |
| [[ɨ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 2 | 1 |
| [[ʏ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 4 | 2 |

So out of the similar sounds, 12 dialects are using it for the GOOSE phoneme and 11 are using it for the FOOT phoneme. It's almost equal! So here are our options:

| Option | STRUT | FOOT | GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 2 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚣ | 
| 3 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 4 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚣᚹ | 

Another option entirely would be to use ᚣ as a rune that represents /ju:/ like in the word "new". The downside of this is that the "yod" is coalesced to the consonant *before* and **not** to the vowel /u:/. So if the yod is written at all, it would make more sense to be thought of as belonging with the previous consonant, not combined with /u:/.

Option 4 is the best because of the STRUT-FOOT (hull-pull) merger and the FOOT-GOOSE merger. *Visually* STRUT and FOOT look similar and *also* FOOT and GOOSE look similar. So FOOT is the meeting point of the two. Also, STRUT is a more open sound than FOOT on the IPA vowel chart and ᚢ looks more visually open than ᚣ.

## ᛇ for FLEECE

Previously, ᛇ was used for "rad*io*" and "g*eo*graphy" as well as the consonant sound in "lo*ch*". We are keeping the consonant sound the same. However, the vowel sound for this rune was more likely [ji(ː)] or [i(ː)j]. We are representing the FLEECE phoneme as /ij/ and as such, this is the perfect shortcut rune for that sound.

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| radio | ᚱᛖᛡᛞᛇ | ᚱᛖᛄᛞᛡᚩᚹ |
| geography | ᚷᛇᚸᚱᛟᚠᛁ | ᚷᛡᚩᚸᚱᛟᚠᛡ |
| fleece | ᚠᛚᛁᛋ | ᚠᛚᛇᛋ |

Users may represent FLEECE as either ᛁᛄ or ᛇ.

## ᛡ for happY vowel

"[happY can be associated with either fleece, kit, or face, with vowel qualities in the range of /i ~ ɪ ~ e ~ ɛ/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/25-happy-lexical-set/)". KIT, FLEECE, and happY are not three distinct sounds. Rather, happY could be either KIT or FLEECE. If anyone has used Shavian before, you know the pain of not having a letter just for this happY phoneme.

Previously, the ᛁ rune represented both KIT and FLEECE and therefore if it was on the end of a word, it could be whatever you wanted it to be. The one issue that would occur from this is the famous confusion of "candied" and "candide".

Now, we have different runes for both KIT and FLEECE. So the happY vowel is now represented with ᛡ. 

ᛄ and ᛡ are famously controversial. Many believe that they are two different styles for the same rune. But the fact is that multiple manuscripts contain both of these runes and they even have different names. That would not be the case if they were just stylistic variants of the same rune.

ᛡ was called "Īor", meaning "eel". ᛄ was called "Gēr", meaning "year". 

If we take each of these runes sounds as being the first phoneme of their names, then ᛡ has an /i/-ish sound and ᛄ has a /j/-ish sound.

The /i/-ish sound is perfect for the happY vowel. And moving ᛄ to the FACE, PRICE, and CHOICE phonemes will make it consistent with the usage of ᚹ in this same regard.

| Latin       | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Kale        | ᛣᛖᛡᛚ         | ᛣᛖᛄᛚ      |
| Kyle        | ᛣᚪᛡᛚ         | ᛣᚪᛄᛚ      |

| Geography   | ᚷᛇᚸᚱᛟᚠᛁ     | ᚷᛡᚩᚸᚱᛟᚠᛡ  |
| Radio       | ᚱᛖᛡᛞᛇ      | ᚱᛖᛄᛞᛡᚩᚹ   |
| Kitty       | ᛣᛁᛏᛁ         | ᛣᛁᛏᛡ      |
| Create      | ᚳᚱᛁᛖᛡᛏ       | ᚳᚱᛡᛖᛄᛏ    |
| Easily (1)  | ᛁᛉᛁᛚᛚᛁ        | ᛁᛄᛉᛁᛚᛡ     |
| Easily (2)  | ᛁᛉᛁᛚᛚᛁ       | ᛇᛉᛁᛚᛡ    |
| Yield (1)   | ᛄᛁᛚᛞ        | ᛄᛁᛄᛚᛞ     |
| Yield (2)   | ᛄᛁᛚᛞ         | ᛄᛇᛚᛞ      |
| Reality   | ᚱᛁᚫᛚᛁᛏᛏᛁ         | ᚱᛡᚫᛚᛁᛏᛡ      |
| Candied     | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞ       | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛡᛞ    |
| Candidly    | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞᛞᛚᛁ     | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞᛚᛡ  |
| Candide (1) | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞ       | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛄᛞ    |
| Candide (2) | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞ      | ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛇᛞ   |

Ultimately, if a user confuses these two runes and uses just one for happY and /j/, it's not the end of the world. But offering this distinction should aid in clarity.

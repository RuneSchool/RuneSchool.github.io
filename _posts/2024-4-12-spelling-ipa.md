# IPA vowel map

Now that we have reasonable sound assignments for the runes, next is to get an understanding of how the vowel runes in particular relate to one another.

Using this chart and [Dr. Lindsey's IPA symbols](/version-2/#lindsey-vowels), we can assign lexical sets for each vowel.

And here is our lexical sets. A big part of this spelling system is that it combines STRUT and commA into a single rune.

In parenthesis you can see the "shortcut" runes. 

Below is the fully condensed and simplfied system.

# About some choices

## ᚢ for STRUT and commA

A big part of the Bobo System is that it combines STRUT and commA into the single rune ᚢ. This is following Geoff Lindsey's lead, but it's also following the lead of Kingsley Read, the designer of the Shavian script. In his next script after Shavian (Quickscript), he too combined "up" and "**a**go" into a single letter.

**I want a spelling system that makes users feel extremely confident in how they use it. That confidence severely declines when we introduce a distinction between STRUT and commA.**

### Stress?

Note that Dr Lindsey does distinguish between a stressed commA and an unstressed commA, but in Quickscript there is no difference.

In systems that distinguish commA from STRUT, this distinction is often a cheat code for showing where the stress is in a word (strut is stressed while commA is not)

In the Bobo System, when we read "lover" (ᛚᚢᚠᚢᚱ), how do we know which syllable is stressed? Well, just like with Latin English today, there are some rules for determining stress. It's just not baked into the alphabet itself like it (sort of) is with Shavian.

For example, in most cases, a diphthong takes the stress over a STRUT. Eg. a*way*, a*go*.

## ᚢᚹ or ᛟ for GOAT

This phoneme is spelled as ᚢᚹ (STRUT or commA + /w/). There are 3 major ways to handle the GOAT diphthong. Start with a THOUGHT/LOT vowel, start with a STRUT vowel, start with a commA vowel. Since we combined STRUT and commA into one rune ᚢ, this just won the day.

Some accents even start the GOAT diphthong with a FOOT sound (/ʊw/). This also works as ᚢᚹ because ᚢ is cousins with the FOOT rune ᚣ. They look alike!

ᛟ is the shortcut rune GOAT. Historically, at least in the Elder Futhark, ᛟ had a clear /o:/ sound. When GOAT is monophthongized, it tends to be very close to that sound. So in that sense, this rune would be sort of coming home to its roots.

In the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc, the sound for this ᛟ rune was closer to /ø/ or /œ/. It is true that these sounds are used for NURSE in some English accents. So it would make sense to have ᛟ for a shortcut rune for the NURSE vowel too. However, we also see that the South African accent uses /œ/ for a monophthong GOAT. This /ø~œ/ range is also a valid starting point for a GOAT diphthong, as in /œw/.


## ᚢᚢᚱ for NURSE

The spelling for the NURSE phoneme is ᚢᚢᚱ. It's no secret that many accents pronounce NURSE with a STRUT+R phoneme. However, there are even some accents that pronounce the STRUT phoneme itself with a /ɜ/ (the traditional NURSE vowel). 

If we think of vowel doubling as having a centering effect, then ᚢᚢ would just bring STRUT closer to /ɜ/ no matter what.

If a user spells NURSE with just ᚢᚱ, it's also not the end of the world. They're basically then combining lettER (unstressed) and NURSE (stressed). However for clarity, we will spell them differently.

# Phonetic or Phonemic?

We want this writing system to be phonemic, similar to Shavian or Quickscript. This means that it doesn't assign specific IPA symbols to each rune. Rather, it assigns a range of possible pronunciations to each rune.

That is why you learn runes based on example words in this course. For example, however you say "dress", you will represent that sound with the rune ᛖ.

A phonemic script ensures that no matter how an accent shifts sounds around, the words will still be understandable around the world.

Now that we have reasonable phonetic *sound* assignments for the runes, we need to apply these runes to *phonemes*. 

Phonemes are typically quite clear and obvious with consonants. So we will spend most of our time on vowels.

# IPA vowel map

The IPA vowel map gives us a lay of the land in terms of where phonetic sounds live. We can use this map of sounds to mark out locations of phonemes.

The most common English accents in the world tend to have phonemes in these locations:

Notice that each vowel rune has a wide area marked out on the map. Each circle is saying "your pronunciation of this rune is somewhere in here".

Using this chart and [Dr. Lindsey's IPA symbols](/version-2/#lindsey-vowels), we can assign lexical sets for each vowel.

A big part of this spelling system is that it combines STRUT and commA into a single rune (more on that below).

In parenthesis you can see the "shortcut" runes. 

Below is the fully condensed and simplfied system.

# About some choices

## ᚢ for STRUT and commA

A big part of the Rune School System is that it combines STRUT and commA into the single rune ᚢ. This is following Geoff Lindsey's lead, but it's also following the lead of Kingsley Read, the designer of the Shavian script. In his next script after Shavian (Quickscript), he too combined "up" and "**a**go" into a single letter.

**I want a spelling system that makes users feel extremely confident in how they use it. That confidence severely declines when we introduce a distinction between STRUT and commA.**

### What about stress?

Note that Dr Lindsey does distinguish between a stressed commA and an unstressed commA, but in Quickscript there is no difference.

In systems that distinguish commA from STRUT, this distinction is often a cheat code for showing where the stress is in a word (strut is stressed while commA is not)

In the Rune School System, when we read "lover" (ᛚᚢᚠᚢᚱ), how do we know which syllable is stressed? Well, just like with Latin English today, there are some rules for determining stress. It's just not baked into the alphabet itself like it (sort of) is with Shavian.

For example, in most cases, a diphthong takes the stress over a STRUT. Eg. a*way*, a*go*.

## ᚢᚹ or ᛟ for GOAT

This phoneme is spelled as ᚢᚹ (STRUT or commA + /w/). There are 3 major ways to handle the GOAT diphthong. Start with a THOUGHT/LOT vowel, start with a STRUT vowel, start with a commA vowel. Since we combined STRUT and commA into one rune ᚢ, this just won the day.

Some accents even start the GOAT diphthong with a FOOT sound (/ʊw/). This also works as ᚢᚹ because ᚢ is cousins with the FOOT rune ᚣ. They look alike!

ᛟ is the shortcut rune GOAT. Historically, at least in the Elder Futhark, ᛟ had a clear /o:/ sound. When GOAT is monophthongized, it tends to be very close to that sound. So in that sense, this rune would be sort of coming home to its roots.

In the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc, the sound for this ᛟ rune was closer to /ø/ or /œ/. It is true that these sounds are used for NURSE in some English accents. So it would make sense to have ᛟ for a shortcut rune for the NURSE vowel too. However, we also see that the South African accent uses /œ/ for a monophthong GOAT. This /ø~œ/ range is also a valid starting point for a GOAT diphthong, as in /œw/.


## ᚢᚢᚱ for NURSE

The spelling for the NURSE phoneme is ᚢᚢᚱ. It's no secret that many accents pronounce NURSE with a STRUT+R phoneme. However, there are even some accents that pronounce the STRUT phoneme itself with a /ɜ/ (the traditional NURSE vowel). 

If we think of vowel doubling as having a centering effect, then ᚢᚢ would bring STRUT closer to /ɜ/.

If a user spells NURSE with just ᚢᚱ, it's okay! That means that they have "lettER" and "NURSE" merged. The spelling system is designed so that phonemes that are close together are also *visually* alike! However for clarity, we will spell them differently.

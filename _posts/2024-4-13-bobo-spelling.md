The Bobo Spelling System is inspired by both Quickscript and Dr Geoff Lindsey.

Our starting point for this, as always, is an IPA vowel map.

And here is our lexical sets. A big part of this spelling system is that it combines STRUT and commA into a single rune.

In parenthesis you can see the "shortcut" runes. 

Below is the fully condensed and simplfied system.

# About some choices

## ᚢ for STRUT and commA

A big part of the Bobo System is that it combines STRUT and commA into the single rune ᚢ. This is following Geoff Lindsey's lead, but it's also following the lead of Kingsley Read, the designer of the Shavian script. In his next script after Shavian (Quickscript), he too combined "up" and "**a**go" into a single letter.

**I want a spelling system that makes users feel extremely confident in how they use it. That confidence severely declines when we introduce a distinction between STRUT and commA.**

Note that Dr Lindsey does distinguish between a stressed commA and an unstressed commA, but in Quickscript there is no difference.

### Stress?

In systems that distinguish commA from STRUT, this distinction is often a cheat code for showing where the stress is in a word.

In the Bobo System, when we read "lover" (ᛚᚢᚠᚢᚱ), how do we know which syllable is stressed? Well, just like with Latin English today, there are some rules for determining stress. It's just not baked into the alphabet itself like it is with Shavian (sort of).

For example, in most cases, a diphthong takes the stress over a STRUT. Eg. a*way*, a*go*.

## ᚢᚹ or ᛟ for GOAT

This phoneme is spelled as ᚢᚹ (STRUT or commA + /w/), with ᛟ as the shortcut rune.

If not using the shortcut ᛟ, to distinguish between "away" and "oasis", you would use a bindrune of ᚢᚹ in "oasis" and use ᚢᚹ unbinded for "away". Similarly, "Halloween" could be spelled with the "ow" as either binded or unbinded ᚢᚹ depending on pronunciation.

Historically, at least in the Elder Futhark, ᛟ had a clear /o:/ sound. When GOAT is monophthongized, it tends to be very close to that sound. So in that sense, this rune would be sort of coming home to its roots.

In the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc, the sound for this ᛟ rune was closer to /ø/ or /œ/. We see that the South African accent uses this sound for a monophthong GOAT. This /ø~œ/ is also a valid nucleus for a sliding GOAT, meaning it could be /œw/. 

Some accents even have more of a FOOT sound for the nucleus in their sliding GOAT phoneme (/ʊw/). This also words as ᚢᚹ because ᚢ is cousins with the FOOT rune ᚣ. They look alike!

## ᚢᚢᚱ for NURSE

The spelling for the NURSE phoneme is ᚢᚢᚱ. It's no secret that many accents pronounce NURSE with a STRUT+R phoneme. However, there are even some accents that pronounce the STRUT phoneme itself with a /ɜ/ (the traditional NURSE vowel). 

If we think of vowel doubling as having a centering effect, then ᚢᚢ would just bring STRUT closer to /ɜ/ no matter what.

# Spelling Guidelines

Overall, this system is designed to be as intuitive as possible.

## commA or KIT

Use the ᚣ rune when in doubt.

Many words like anal**y**sis voy**a**ge, invis**i**ble are quite tricky to spell. Do you write them with a KIT, commA, or even a FOOT?

Refer again to the IPA map:

![IPA vowel map](/assets/images/runeSchool2IPAmapNoSchwa.png)

In our system, the FOOT rune ᚣ is not only a middle ground between ᚢ and ᛁ, but the rune itself visually looks like an ᛁ inside of a ᚢ. For this reason, it could be best to spell these sounds with FOOT ᚣ. So if there is a sound that could be either commA or KIT, go with 

What about "analysis" (ənáləsɪs) vs "unorthodox" (ənóːθədɔks). Two options present themselves. 

1. Use bindrunes to show ᚢᚾ as the single self-contained prefix "un-".
2. Spell "analysis" with a more etymological ᚫᚾ at the beginning. Remember ᚫ has a toe that touches closer to the center of the IPA vowel chart too! And keep in mind that "analysis" has the prefix "ana-" like in the word "anagram".

## lettER or hUrry

A separate phoneme for "fur" is really quite rare in the English world. However, we have saved a place for it in the Bobo System as ᚢᚱ or ᚣᚱ, just in case people want to use it.

A bindrune for ᚢᚱ can be used for "lettER" (/ər/) while being unbinded for "hurry" (/ʌr/?) 

## KIT or FLEECE

Use the happY rune ᛡ when in doubt.

## Syllabic consonants

Write just ᚱ, ᛚ, ᛗ, or ᚾ where you see 𐑼 or 𐑩𐑤, 𐑩𐑯, or 𐑩𐑥.

In most places you see **𐑼** or **𐑩𐑤**, it is because there is a glide right before it. We write the glides, so we don't need to explicitly include the schwas. Only write ᛟᚱ if it represents the suffix -er, or similar.

In many (not all) places where you see **𐑩𐑯** or **𐑩𐑥**, you can just right the ᛗ or ᚾ directly without the schwa needed.

### Shortcut words

| Latin | Shavian | Runes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| the | 𐑞 | ᚦ |
| to | 𐑑 | ᛏ |
| and | 𐑯 | ᚾ |
| for | 𐑓 | ᚠᚱ |
| of | 𐑝 | ᚠ |

### Vowel reduction

The range of pronunciation for all vowel runes has a bit that reaches into the center where ᛟ lives.

So in many cases when a vowel is being "reduced", it may just be sliding closer to the center part of its range of possible pronunciations because of a change in rhythm (prosody) of speech.

The ReadLex swaps a vowel to schwa very often, but we would just temper that habit a bit.

Only use ᛟ when there is no other option, because swapping a vowel rune entirely may hurt recognizablity of some words. Consider the importance of maintaining visual similarity between word derivations and shortenings.

More often than not, if a diphthong is being reduced, you can just remove the glide.

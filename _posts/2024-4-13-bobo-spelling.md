---

The Bobo Spelling System is inspired by [Shavian](https://shavian.info), [Quickscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quikscript), [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online), [Stella](https://rentry.co/merunes), and [Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/@DrGeoffLindsey).

# Goals

Be true and authentic to the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. Do not add in foreign runes or wildly change rune sounds.

# The Runes

Let's get a good look at them with some cool ASCII arrangements.

Extra runes separate:

## -- Assigning sounds

Here is a list of runes so that you can see how this system has kept them the same or changed them. The text is green if it is the same, orange if it slightly different, and red if it is a fairly large difference.

The only real changes to address are Double-Feoh, ᚣ, ᛠ, ᛉ, ᛡ, and ᚷ.

### --- ᛉ 

Old English didn't have a known sound for ᛉ despite keeping it in their rune rows. Some think that it made the sound of /ks/ like the latin "x", but it is unsure. Going back to the Elder Futhark, this had a /z/ sound, so we just keep that sound.

### --- ᚷ 

The original sound of ᚷ was /j/, but when French began to influence English after the Norman invasion (~1100), /j/ started to become /dʒ/ in English, [just like in French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_French#To_Early_Old_French[when?]) (Think of how the word Jehovah or Jesus changed in pronunciation over time). So also taking into account that ᛄ is already /j/, we can reduce historical ᚷᚷ to just ᚷ for /dʒ/.

### --- ᛠ 

[In Old English, the word "ear" was pronounced like /ˈæ͜ɑː.re/](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eare#Old_English), which would have used this rune. Over time, this word "ear" began to sound like /ɪə/. This is partially documented in the Great Vowel Shift where words with "ea" eventually began to sound like words with "ee". There are some people today who [pronounce NEAR like /ɛə̯/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/19-near-lexical-set/#mergers) which also shows a bit of a remnant that still pronounces "ear" closer to how it used to be said. So we can assign this rune to the NEAR lexical set, where the pronunciation has mostly shifted from /æːɑ/ to /iːə/.  

### --- ᚣ

This rune visually looks like ᛁ inside of ᚢ and would thus be appropriate for any of the sounds between /i/ and /u/ on the IPA sound chart.

The ᚣ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. It's hard to find a modern day correlate to this sound. But let's look at the data:

| Sound similar to /y/ | Dialects using it for FOOT | Dialects using it for GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 0 | 4 |
| [[ʉ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 5 | 6 |
| [[ɨ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 2 | 1 |
| [[ʏ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 4 | 2 |

So out of the similar sounds, 12 dialects are using it for the GOOSE phoneme and 11 are using it for the FOOT phoneme. It's almost equal! So here are our options:

| Option | STRUT | FOOT | GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 2 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚣ | 
| 3 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 4 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚣᚹ | 

Another option entirely would be to use ᚣ as a rune that represents /ju:/ like in the word "new". The downside of this is that the "yod" is coalesced to the consonant *before* and **not** to the vowel /u:/. So if the yod is written at all, it would make more sense to be thought of as belonging with the previous consonant, not combined with /u:/.

Option 4 is the best because of the STRUT-FOOT (hull-pull) merger and the FOOT-GOOSE merger. *Visually* STRUT and FOOT look similar and *also* FOOT and GOOSE look similar. So FOOT is the meeting point of the two. Also, STRUT is a more open sound than FOOT on the IPA vowel chart and ᚢ looks more visually open than ᚣ.

### --- ᛡ 

"[happY can be associated with either fleece, kit, or face, with vowel qualities in the range of /i ~ ɪ ~ e ~ ɛ/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/25-happy-lexical-set/)". KIT, FLEECE, and happY are not three distinct sounds. Rather, happY could be either KIT or FLEECE. If anyone has used Shavian before, you know the pain of not having a letter just for this happY phoneme.

Previously, the ᛁ rune represented both KIT and FLEECE and therefore if it was on the end of a word, it could be whatever you wanted it to be. The one issue that would occur from this is the famous confusion of "candied" and "candide".

Now, we have different runes for both KIT and FLEECE. So the happY vowel is now represented with ᛡ. 

ᛄ and ᛡ are famously controversial. Many believe that they are two different styles for the same rune. But the fact is that multiple manuscripts contain both of these runes and they even have different names. That would not be the case if they were just stylistic variants of the same rune.

ᛡ was called "Īor", meaning "eel". ᛄ was called "Gēr", meaning "year". 

If we take each of these runes sounds as being the first phoneme of their names, then ᛡ has an /i/-ish sound and ᛄ has a /j/-ish sound.

The /i/-ish sound is perfect for the happY vowel. And moving ᛄ to the FACE, PRICE, and CHOICE phonemes will make it consistent with the usage of ᚹ in this same regard.

| Latin       |  Runes |
| ----------- |  --------- |
| Kale        |  ᛣᛖᛄᛚ      |
| Kyle        |  ᛣᚪᛄᛚ      |
| Coil        |  ᛣᚩᛄᛚ      |
| Geography   |  ᚷᛡᚩᚸᚱᛟᚠᛡ  |
| Radio       | ᚱᛖᛄᛞᛡᚩᚹ   |
| Kitty       |  ᛣᛁᛏᛡ      |
| Create      | ᚳᚱᛡᛖᛄᛏ    |
| Easily (1)  |  ᛁᛄᛉᛁᛚᛡ     |
| Easily (2)  |  ᛇᛉᛁᛚᛡ    |
| Yield (1)   | ᛄᛁᛄᛚᛞ     |
| Yield (2)   |  ᛄᛇᛚᛞ      |
| Reality   |  ᚱᛡᚫᛚᛁᛏᛡ      |
| Candied     |  ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛡᛞ    |
| Candidly    |  ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛞᛚᛡ  |
| Candide (1) |  ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛁᛄᛞ    |
| Candide (2) |  ᛣᚫᚾᛞᛇᛞ   |

Ultimately, if a user ᛄ and ᛡ and uses just one for both happY and /j/, it's not the end of the world. But offering this distinction should aid in clarity.

### --- ᚢ 

STRUT originally came from the "short u" sound. Because of this, it's appropriate to think that if runes had continued in use, people would have eventually started to pronounce ᚢ as a STRUT. 

### --- Double-Feoh

Double-Feoh is applying the same idea behind ᚳ and ᛣ to ᚠ.

# IPA vowel map

Now that we have reasonable sound assignments for the runes, next is to get an understanding of how the vowel runes in particular relate to one another.

![IPA vowel map](/assets/images/runeSchool2IPAmapNoSchwa.png)

Using this chart and [Dr. Lindsey's IPA symbols](/version-2/#lindsey-vowels), we can assign lexical sets for each vowel.

And here is our lexical sets. A big part of this spelling system is that it combines STRUT and commA into a single rune.

![Bobo Lexical Sets](/assets/images/BoboLexicalSets.png)

In parenthesis you can see the "shortcut" runes. 

Below is the fully condensed and simplfied system.

# About some choices

## -- ᚢ for STRUT and commA

A big part of the Bobo System is that it combines STRUT and commA into the single rune ᚢ. This is following Geoff Lindsey's lead, but it's also following the lead of Kingsley Read, the designer of the Shavian script. In his next script after Shavian (Quickscript), he too combined "up" and "**a**go" into a single letter.

**I want a spelling system that makes users feel extremely confident in how they use it. That confidence severely declines when we introduce a distinction between STRUT and commA.**

### --- Stress?

Note that Dr Lindsey does distinguish between a stressed commA and an unstressed commA, but in Quickscript there is no difference.

In systems that distinguish commA from STRUT, this distinction is often a cheat code for showing where the stress is in a word (strut is stressed while commA is not)

In the Bobo System, when we read "lover" (ᛚᚢᚠᚢᚱ), how do we know which syllable is stressed? Well, just like with Latin English today, there are some rules for determining stress. It's just not baked into the alphabet itself like it (sort of) is with Shavian.

For example, in most cases, a diphthong takes the stress over a STRUT. Eg. a*way*, a*go*.

## -- ᚢᚹ or ᛟ for GOAT

This phoneme is spelled as ᚢᚹ (STRUT or commA + /w/). There are 3 major ways to handle the GOAT diphthong. Start with a THOUGHT/LOT vowel, start with a STRUT vowel, start with a commA vowel. Since we combined STRUT and commA into one rune ᚢ, this just won the day.

Some accents even start the GOAT diphthong with a FOOT sound (/ʊw/). This also works as ᚢᚹ because ᚢ is cousins with the FOOT rune ᚣ. They look alike!

ᛟ is the shortcut rune GOAT. Historically, at least in the Elder Futhark, ᛟ had a clear /o:/ sound. When GOAT is monophthongized, it tends to be very close to that sound. So in that sense, this rune would be sort of coming home to its roots.

In the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc, the sound for this ᛟ rune was closer to /ø/ or /œ/. It is true that these sounds are used for NURSE in some English accents. So it would make sense to have ᛟ for a shortcut rune for the NURSE vowel too. However, we also see that the South African accent uses /œ/ for a monophthong GOAT. This /ø~œ/ range is also a valid starting point for a GOAT diphthong, as in /œw/.


## -- ᚢᚢᚱ for NURSE

The spelling for the NURSE phoneme is ᚢᚢᚱ. It's no secret that many accents pronounce NURSE with a STRUT+R phoneme. However, there are even some accents that pronounce the STRUT phoneme itself with a /ɜ/ (the traditional NURSE vowel). 

If we think of vowel doubling as having a centering effect, then ᚢᚢ would just bring STRUT closer to /ɜ/ no matter what.

If a user spells NURSE with just ᚢᚱ, it's also not the end of the world. They're basically then combining lettER (unstressed) and NURSE (stressed). However for clarity, we will spell them differently.

# Spelling Guidelines

Overall, this system is designed to be as intuitive as possible. As mentioned above, confidence with the user is paramount. A user should be able to spell confidently without consulting a dictionary.

However, we encourage users to reference the [Shavian ReadLex](https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com/), [Cube Dictionary](http://cubedictionary.org/), or [QuickScript dictionary](https://github.com/akovaski/QS-Dict) and base their spellings off of those.

| Modern IPA | Shavian | Runes |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| ə́ | 𐑳 | ᚢ | 
| ə́w | 𐑴 | ᚢᚹ or ᛟ |
| ə | 𐑩 or 𐑼 | ᚢ or ᚢᚱ |

| ə́w | 𐑺 | ᛖᛖᚱ |
| ə́w | 𐑻 | ᚢᚢᚱ |
| ə́w | 𐑿 | ᛄᚣᚹ |

## -- commA or KIT

Use the ᚣ rune when in doubt.

Many words like anal**y**sis voy**a**ge, invis**i**ble are quite tricky to spell. Do you write them with a KIT, commA, or even a FOOT?

Refer again to the IPA map:

![IPA vowel map](/assets/images/runeSchool2IPAmapNoSchwa.png)

In our system, the FOOT rune ᚣ is not only a middle ground between ᚢ and ᛁ, but the rune itself visually looks like an ᛁ inside of a ᚢ. For this reason, it could be best to spell these sounds with FOOT ᚣ. So if there is a sound that could be either commA or KIT, go with ᚣ.

## -- commA or STRUT

What about "analysis" (ənáləsɪs) vs "unorthodox" (ənóːθədɔks). Two options present themselves. 

1. Use bindrunes to show ᚢᚾ as the single self-contained prefix "un-".
2. Spell "analysis" with a more etymological ᚫᚾ at the beginning. Remember ᚫ has a toe that touches closer to the center of the IPA vowel chart too! And keep in mind that "analysis" has the prefix "ana-" like in the word "anagram".

What about "away" and "oasis"? If not using the shortcut ᛟ, to distinguish between "away" and "oasis", you would use a bindrune of ᚢᚹ in "oasis" and use ᚢᚹ unbinded for "away". Similarly, "Halloween" could be spelled with the "ow" as either binded or unbinded ᚢᚹ depending on pronunciation.

## -- lettER or hUrry

A separate phoneme for "fur" is really quite rare in the English world. However, we have saved a place for it in the Bobo System as ᚢᚱ or ᚣᚱ, just in case people want to use it.

A bindrune for ᚢᚱ can be used for "lettER" (/ər/) while being unbinded for "hurry" (/ʌr/?) 

## -- KIT or FLEECE

Use the happY rune ᛡ when in doubt.

## -- Syllabic consonants

Write just ᚱ, ᛚ, ᛗ, or ᚾ where you see 𐑼 or 𐑩𐑤, 𐑩𐑯, or 𐑩𐑥.

In most places you see **𐑼** or **𐑩𐑤**, it is because there is a glide right before it. We write the glides, so we don't need to explicitly include the schwas. Only write ᛟᚱ if it represents the suffix -er, or similar.

In many (not all) places where you see **𐑩𐑯** or **𐑩𐑥**, you can just right the ᛗ or ᚾ directly without the schwa needed.

## -- Etymology Spelling?

We recomend a sound-based spelling system because that is the more practical and efficient system. George Bernard Shaw, when he advocated for Shavian, believed in ignoring everything about etymology in such a script because all etymology does is obscure the efficiency of the tool that is the written language. We agree with that sentiment. The number one concern with spelling should be conveying your message simply, clearly, and with as little effort as possible.

*However*, the system does allow for a more etymology-based spelling if you take into account the fact that each vowel rune has one toe that dips into the center of the vowel chart.

So for example if you want to spell a word or name that has "-son" at the end of it, a sound-based spelling would be "-ᛋᚢᚾ", while a more etymology-based spelling would be "-ᛋᚩᚾ". In the etymology-based spelling there, it's just understood that the ᚩ is reduced towards the center based on [stress timing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony#Stress_timing). If users wish to keep stress timing in mind, they may end up using the commA/STRUT rune less and less.

More often than not, if a diphthong is being reduced, you can just remove the glide.

Overall, users are encouraged to write however they feel most comfortable. If that means you put schwa's all over the place, go for it!

This post is to answer some questions that you may have about the [Rune School spelling system](/rune-school-spelling-system/).

# What about my accent?

## Non-rhotic

Firstly, this system is designed to allow you to drop Rs if you wish to. For example, if you are speaking to a non-rhotic audience, you may wish to write more exactly in your accent.

| Latin | standard | non-rhotic |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Near | ᚾᛠᚱ | ᚾᛠ |
| Square | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᛖᚱ | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᛖ |
| Spar | ᛋᛈᚪᚱ | ᛋᛈᚪ |
| North | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ | ᚾᚩᚦ |
| Hire | ᚻᚫᛡᛟᚱ | ᚻᚫᛡᛟ |
| Higher | ᚻᚫᛡᛟᚱ | ᚻᚫᛡᛟ |

However, it is this author's understanding that many non-rhotic speakers consider "spar" to be a different phoneme from "spa" even if they sound the same when spoken. "Spar" has a potential linking-r while the other does not. In this sense, you may wish to continue writing the R.

"Know your audience". This system is capable of being flexible depending on your needs. We would always recommend writing the Rs for an international audience, however.

## Rhotic

Similar to the above, you may wish to remove some schwas ᛟ that are obvious to you.

| Latin | Standard | Rhotic |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Hire | ᚻᚫᛡᛟᚱ | ᚻᚫᛡᚱ |
| Higher | ᚻᚫᛡᛟᚱ | ᚻᚫᛡᚱ |
| Hour | ᚫᚹᛟᚱ | ᚫᚹᚱ |
| Fewer | ᚠᛡᚣᚹᛟᚱ | ᚠᛡᚣᚹᚱ |
| They're | ᚦᛖᛡᛟᚱ | ᚦᛖᛡᚱ |
| Runner | ᚱᚢᚾᛟᚱ | ᚱᚢᚾᚱ |

But you may wish to retain the schwa in cases where there is an obvious suffix like -er.

| Latin | Standard | Rhotic |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Runner | ᚱᚢᚾᛟᚱ | ᚱᚢᚾᛟᚱ |
| Higher | ᚻᚫᛡᛟᚱ | ᚻᚫᛡᛟᚱ |

## Yods and Yod coalescence

To understand what this is, let's look at some examples

| Latin | Yod dropping | Standard | Yod coalescence |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Dune | ᛞᚣᚹᚾ | ᛞᛡᚣᚹᚾ | ᚷᚣᚹᚾ |
| Tube | ᛏᚣᚹᛒ | ᛏᛡᚣᚹᛒ | ᚳᚣᚹᛒ |

The ᛡ is either dropped or combines with the consonant before it to change the consonant sound.

For communicating internationally, we are going to recommend the [Goldilocks principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) and take the middle path of the Yod if at all possible. However, there are some instances where Yod coalescence is very common. Quoting the Shavian ReadLex:

> Yod-coalescence is generally accepted where it occurs in RP and GA, so ‘fortune’ is /fɔː(r)tʃuːn/ ᚠᚩᚱᛏᚣᚹᚾ not /fɔː(r)tjuːn/ ᚠᚩᚱᛏᛡᚣᚹᚾ. However, where GA pronounces a plain /uː/ with no ‘yod’, and RP has a ‘yod’, then for intelligibility the ‘yod’ is retained uncoalesced, so ‘aptitude’ is /æptɪtjuːd/ ᚫᛈᛏᛁᛏᛡᚣᚹᛞ, not /æptɪtʃuːd/ ᚫᛈᛏᛁᚳᚣᚹᛞ.

As always, if you know your audience, write how you wish! Use your own judgement.

## NEAR or SQUARE sounds different

NEAR and SQUARE lexical sets are hard to pin down. You could pronounce either of them in one of these three boxes (red, purple, blue).

In this approach, we are going with the [Goldilocks principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle). Not hot (red), not cold (blue), but just right (purple). 

Consider:

| Latin | Runes |
| --- | --- | 
| There / They're | ᚦᛖᛖᚱ / ᚦᛖᛡᛟᚱ |
| keyring / hearing | ᛣᛇᚱᛁᛝ / ᚻᛠᚱᛁᛝ |

## Don't have the FACE merger

If you don't have the FACE merger and instead have two distinct lexical sets of PANE and PAIN, I would suggest that you use a bindrune of ᛖ‍ᛄ for the PANE set to indicate that it is a closer monophthong and an unbound combination of ᛖᛄ for PAIN to indicate that it is the full diphthong.

## Don't have NURSE merger

If you don't have the NURSE merger and instead pronounce "fur", "fir", and "fern" distinctly, I recommend spelling each with ᚢᚱ, ᛁᚱ, and ᛖᚱ respectively.

## Don't have NORTH-FORCE merger

If you don't have the NORTH-FORCE merger, you can spell NORTH words with ᚩᚱ and FORCE words with ᚩᚹᚱ. If there are no potential homophones that need distinguishing, it is recommended to stick with ᚩᚱ.

## Chews sounds different than choose

If "chews" sounds different than "choose", you can use ᛁᚹ for "chews" and ᚣᚹ for "choose".

## Merge lettER and NURSE

Does lettER sound the same as NURSE to you? NURSE ᛟᛟᚱ is stressed where lettER ᛟᚱ is not.

## Merge commA and STRUT

Does commA sound the same as STRUT to you? STRUT ᚢ is stressed where commA ᛟ is not.

# The article A

The sound in the article a can be a wide range of things.

* a = /e:~ə~ɐ/
* an = /æn~ən/

The Shavian standard spelling has opted to go with the schwa for the default phoneme for this, which is ᛟ/ᛟᚾ in our case.

It's not a bad solution considering that it is the weak pronunciation of both forms of the article, and this article is in the weak form most often. But what about when this article is in the strong form? Should we spell it ᛖᛡ or ᚫᚾ?

What we are dealing with is the reality that each phoneme has a nucleus which is its "home", but each phoneme can also stray from it's home. In this case, the article "a" in English is something like the below.

![English article A phoneme](/assets/images/article-a.png)

The dark red is the "home" or nucleus of this sound (somewhere around ᚫ for us), and the lighter red is where it can float to in different situations. When it is stronger, it can go up to the top left like ᛖᛡ, and when it is weaker it can go to the right more like ᛟ.

Essentially, this article can float around, but the nucleus lives closer to ᚫ. So why not spell the article with ᚫ instead of ᛟ. 

If we got into the habit of saying ᚫ can sometimes sound like ᛖᛡ, then we would have to start spelling words like angel as ᚫᚾᚷᛟᛚ and angle as ᚫᚾᚸᛟᛚ. And if we said that ᚫ can sometimes sound like ᛟ *in this one scenario*, then people would mistakenly spell words like "comma" like ᛣᚩᛗᚫ. In this spelling system, it is best to have more clear boundaries for phonemes so that the user can confidently spell things. If a sound goes from ᚫ to ᛖᛡ, we want to show that.

So why is ᛟ better? It still floats around in sound, right? By using ᛟ/ᛟᚾ for all cases of this article, we relegate all of the ambiguity and sound shifting to just one letter ᛟ while keeping all other letters with clear boundaries.

Also, just from an evidential standpoint, ᛟ is the only valid phoneme that is in *both* "a" and "an".

However, if you want to write in a way that clearly shows the exact pronunciation of a speaker, then maybe you would change ᛟ to ᛖᛡ or ᚫᚾ.

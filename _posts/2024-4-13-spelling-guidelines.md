# Spelling Guidelines

Overall, this system is designed to be as intuitive as possible. As mentioned above, confidence with the user is paramount. A user should be able to spell confidently without consulting a dictionary.

However, we encourage users to reference the [Shavian ReadLex](https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com/), [Cube Dictionary](http://cubedictionary.org/), or [QuickScript dictionary](https://github.com/akovaski/QS-Dict) and base their spellings off of those.

| Modern IPA | Shavian | Runes |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| ə́ | 𐑳 | ᚢ | 
| ə́w | 𐑴 | ᚢᚹ or ᛟ |
| ə | 𐑩 or 𐑼 | ᚢ or ᚢᚱ |
| ə́w | 𐑦 | ᛁ |
| ə́w | 𐑰 | ᛁᛄ or ᛇ |
| ə́w | 𐑧 | ᛖ |
| ə́w | 𐑱 | ᛖᛄ |
| ə́w | 𐑨 | ᚫ |
| ə́w | 𐑲 | ᚪᛄ |
| ə́w | 𐑭 | ᚪ |
| ə́w | 𐑸 | ᚪᚱ |
| ə́w | 𐑪 | ᚩ |
| ə́w | 𐑷 | ᚩᚩ |
| ə́w | 𐑹 | ᚩᚱ |
| ə́w | 𐑫 | ᚣ |
| ə́w | 𐑵 | ᚣᚹ |
| ə́w | 𐑬 | ᚪᚹ |
| ə́w | 𐑶 | ᚩᛄ |
| ə́w | 𐑺 | ᛖᛖᚱ |
| ə́w | 𐑻 | ᚢᚢᚱ |
| ə́w | 𐑿 | ᛄᚣᚹ |

## commA or KIT

Use the ᚣ rune when in doubt.

Many words like anal**y**sis voy**a**ge, invis**i**ble are quite tricky to spell. Do you write them with a KIT, commA, or even a FOOT?

Refer again to the IPA map:

![IPA vowel map](/assets/images/runeSchool2IPAmapNoSchwa.png)

In our system, the FOOT rune ᚣ is not only a middle ground between ᚢ and ᛁ, but the rune itself visually looks like an ᛁ inside of a ᚢ. For this reason, it could be best to spell these sounds with FOOT ᚣ. So if there is a sound that could be either commA or KIT, go with ᚣ.

| Latin | Readlex (Shavian) | Rune School |
| %% | %% | %% | %% |
| parted | 𐑐𐑸𐑑𐑩𐑛  | ᛈᚪᚱᛏᛁᛞ or ᛈᚪᚱᛏᚢᛞ? Try ᛈᚪᚱᛏᚣᛞ |
| roses | 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟  | ᚱᚢᚹᛉᛁᛉ or ᚱᚢᚹᛉᚢᛉ? Try ᚱᚢᚹᛉᚣᛉ |

## commA or STRUT

What about "analysis" (ənáləsɪs) vs "unorthodox" (ənóːθədɔks). Two options present themselves. 

1. Use bindrunes to show ᚢᚾ as the single self-contained prefix "un-".
2. Spell "analysis" with a more etymological ᚫᚾ at the beginning. Remember ᚫ has a toe that touches closer to the center of the IPA vowel chart too! And keep in mind that "analysis" has the prefix "ana-" like in the word "anagram".

ᚢᚾᚫᛚᚣᛋᛁᛋ
ᚫᚾᚫᛚᚣᛋᛁᛋ
ᚢᚾᛟᚱᚦᚢᛞᚩᛣᛋ

What about "away" and "oasis"? If not using the shortcut ᛟ, to distinguish between "away" and "oasis", you would use a bindrune of ᚢᚹ in "oasis" and use ᚢᚹ unbinded for "away". Similarly, "Halloween" could be spelled with the "ow" as either binded or unbinded ᚢᚹ depending on pronunciation.

## lettER or hUrry

A separate phoneme for "fur" is really quite rare in the English world. However, we have saved a place for it in the Bobo System as ᚢᚱ or ᚣᚱ, just in case people want to use it.

A bindrune for ᚢᚱ can be used for "lettER" (/ər/) while being unbinded for "hurry" (/ʌr/?) 

## KIT or FLEECE

Use the happY rune ᛡ when in doubt.

## Syllabic consonants

Write just ᚱ, ᛚ, ᛗ, or ᚾ where you see 𐑼 or 𐑩𐑤, 𐑩𐑯, or 𐑩𐑥.

In most places you see **𐑼** or **𐑩𐑤**, it is because there is a glide right before it. We write the glides, so we don't need to explicitly include the schwas. Only write ᛟᚱ if it represents the suffix -er, or similar.

In many (not all) places where you see **𐑩𐑯** or **𐑩𐑥**, you can just right the ᛗ or ᚾ directly without the schwa needed.

## Shortcut words

| Latin | Shavian | Runes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| the | 𐑞 | ᚦ |
| to | 𐑑 | ᛏ |
| and | 𐑯 | ᚾ |
| for | 𐑓 | ᚠᚱ |
| of | 𐑝 | ᚠ |

## Etymology Spelling?

We recomend a sound-based spelling system because that is the more practical and efficient system. George Bernard Shaw, when he advocated for Shavian, believed in ignoring everything about etymology in such a script because all etymology does is obscure the efficiency of the tool that is the written language. We agree with that sentiment. The number one concern with spelling should be conveying your message simply, clearly, and with as little effort as possible.

*However*, the system does allow for a more etymology-based spelling if you take into account the fact that each vowel rune has one toe that dips into the center of the vowel chart.

So for example if you want to spell a word or name that has "-son" at the end of it, a sound-based spelling would be "-ᛋᚢᚾ", while a more etymology-based spelling would be "-ᛋᚩᚾ". In the etymology-based spelling there, it's just understood that the ᚩ is reduced towards the center based on [stress timing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony#Stress_timing). If users wish to keep stress timing in mind, they may end up using the commA/STRUT rune less and less.

More often than not, if a diphthong is being reduced, you can just remove the glide.

| Latin | Normal | Worse | Better |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| today | ᛏᚣᚹᛞᛖᛄ | ᛏᚢᛞᛖᛄ | ᛏᚣᛞᛖᛄ |
| pika | ᛈᛇᛣᚪᚳᚣᚹ | ᛈᛇᛣᚢ | ᛈᛇᛣᚪ |

Overall, users are encouraged to write however they feel most comfortable. If that means you put schwas all over the place, go for it!

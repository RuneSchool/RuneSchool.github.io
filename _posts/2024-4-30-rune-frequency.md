Which are the runes that are most common in the Rune School Spelling System?

Since the spelling is largely based on the Shavian [ReadLex](https://readlex.pythonanywhere.com/spellingprinciples/) standard, we should be able to use that as a base of information to determine this.

Lets look at letter frequency [in Shavian](https://www.reddit.com/r/shavian/comments/ovke9g/shavian_letter_frequencies/) and compare with the Runic equivalents.

| Shavian | Frequency | Runes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 𐑦 |   8.70% | ᛁ |
| 𐑯 |   7.86% | ᚾ |
| 𐑑  |  7.67% | ᛏ |
| 𐑩 |   5.84% | ᛟ |
| 𐑕 |   5.27% | ᛋ |
| 𐑤 |   4.33% | ᛚ |
| 𐑛  |  3.74% | ᛞ |
| 𐑞 |   3.54% | ᚦ |
| 𐑒  |  3.44% | ᛣ |
| 𐑟  |  3.19% | ᛉ |
| 𐑥 |   3.02% | ᛗ |
|  𐑮 |   2.71% | ᚱ |
| 𐑧 |   2.52% | ᛖ |
| 𐑐 |   2.35% | ᛈ |
| 𐑨  |  2.34% | ᚫ |
| 𐑝  |  2.31% | ᚠ |
| 𐑢 |   2.15% | ᚹ |
| 𐑼 |   2.04% | ᛟᚱ |
| 𐑚  |  2.02% | ᛒ |
|  𐑰 |   2.01% | ᛇ |
|  𐑪  |  2.00% | ᚩ |
| 𐑓 |   1.91% | ᚠ |
| 𐑱  |  1.80% | ᛖᛡ |
|  𐑲  |  1.74% | ᚫᛡ |
|  𐑣  |  1.54% | ᚻ |
| 𐑳  |  1.53% | ᚢ |
|  𐑴 |   1.28% | ᚩᚹ |
|  𐑖 |   1.08% | ᛋᚳ |
|  𐑙 |   1.01% | ᛝ |
|  𐑜 |   0.84% | ᚸ |
|  𐑻 |   0.78% | ᚢᚱ |
|  𐑹  |  0.74% | ᚩᚱ |
|  𐑵 |   0.71% | ᚣᚹ |
|  𐑿 |   0.67% | ᛡᚣᚹ |
|  𐑗  |  0.64% | ᚳ |
|  𐑡  |  0.63% | ᚷ |
|  𐑬 |   0.56% | ᚫᚹ |
|  𐑸 |   0.47% | ᚪᚱ |
|  𐑫 |   0.44% | ᚣ |
|  𐑷 |   0.44% | ᚩᚩ |
|  𐑔 |   0.42% | ᚦ |
|  𐑺 |   0.39% | ᛖᛖᚱ |
|  𐑘 |   0.35% | ᛡ |
|  𐑭 |   0.29% | ᚪ |
|  𐑽 |   0.25% | ᛠᚱ |
|  𐑾 |   0.23% | ᛠ |
| 𐑶  |  0.11% | ᚩᛡ |
| 𐑠 |   0.08% | ᛉᚳ |

Now if we break apart the runes used in combination, we get the following:

| Frequency | Runes |
| --- | --- | 
|   8.70% | ᛁ |
|   7.88% | ᛟ |
|   7.86% | ᚾ |
|  7.67% | ᛏ |
|   7.38% | ᚱ |
|   6.35% | ᛋ |
|   5.37% | ᚹ |
|   5.10% | ᛖ |
|  5.01% | ᚩ |
|   4.67% | ᛡ |
|  4.64% | ᚫ |
|   4.33% | ᛚ |
|   3.96% | ᚦ |
|  3.74% | ᛞ |
|  3.44% | ᛣ |
|  3.27% | ᛉ |
|   3.02% | ᛗ |
|   2.35% | ᛈ |
|  2.31% | ![ff bindrune](/assets/images/ff-bindrune.png) |
|  2.31% | ᚢ |
|  2.02% | ᛒ |
|   2.01% | ᛇ |
|   1.91% | ᚠ |
|   1.82% | ᚣ |
|  1.80% | ᚳ |
|  1.54% | ᚻ |
|   1.01% | ᛝ |
|   0.84% | ᚸ |
|   0.76% | ᚪ |
|  0.63% | ᚷ |
|   0.48% | ᛠ |

Note that Shavian often assumes that you pronounce words like "lot" with ᚩ, but most Americans would probably use ᚪ for this sound, boosting it up in percentage.

And if we got rid of the shortcut runes, the chart would be something like the following. This might be useful for a game like Scrabble, for example.

| Frequency | Runes |
| --- | --- | 
|   11.67% | ᛁ |
|   7.88% | ᛟ |
|   7.86% | ᚾ |
|  7.67% | ᛏ |
|   7.38% | ᚱ |
|   6.68% | ᛡ |
|   6.35% | ᛋ |
|  6.16% | ᚫ |
|   5.37% | ᚹ |
|   5.10% | ᛖ |
|  5.01% | ᚩ |
|   4.33% | ᛚ |
|   4.22% | ᚠ |
|   3.96% | ᚦ |
|  3.74% | ᛞ |
|  3.44% | ᛣ |
|  3.27% | ᛉ |
|   3.02% | ᛗ |
|   2.35% | ᛈ |
|  2.31% | ᚢ |
|  2.02% | ᛒ |
|   1.82% | ᚣ |
|  1.80% | ᚳ |
|  1.54% | ᚻ |
|   1.01% | ᛝ |
|   0.84% | ᚸ |
|  0.63% | ᚷ |

# Findings

Overall, ᛟ and ᛁ are the most common vowels in the Rune School Spelling System by far. 

Of the three vowel sisters ᚫᚪᚩ, ᚫ and ᚩ will be about equally frequent with ᚪ being more rare. I think this is appropriate since ᚪ is in between the other two.

ᚩ is the first rune in terms of frequency that is unique to just the Anglo-Saxon runes. So if you're trying to determine which language is being written with some runes, you will likely notice ᚩ and know that it is English. Seeing ᛣ will be the next clue that you're reading English.

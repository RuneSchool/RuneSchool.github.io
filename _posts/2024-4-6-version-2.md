Rune School is breaking away from the original spelling system and updating it based on their own experience and learnings.

A couple of things inspired this:

1. A reddit comment about how doubled vowels are attested in the futhorc corpus

2. A user complaint about the word unknown in runes: ᚪᚾᚾᚾᚩᚢᚾ

I had been playing around with my own changes to the spelling system for a long time, but I wasn't ready to show anything yet.

The goals of the spelling changes are twofold.

1. Align vowels to better match the organization [explained by Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA)

2. Drastically reduce the amount of doubling of runes

# Before and After

Here are some before and after texts to give the reader a taste of the changes.

# Changes

## Lindsey Vowels

What I call the "Lindsey Vowels" are below:

![](/assets/images/LindseyVowels.png)

You can see a similar chart in Labov's Atlas of North American English. Dr Geoff Lindsey did not invent this organization of vowels.

You can see that the overall grouping of vowels is short vowels (red), "linking r" or lengthened vowels (yellow), and glide vowels (sea green).

Based on this grouping, I have created my own to suit our needs a bit better.

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolVowelChart.png)

You can see that I have tried to show a bit more cleanly not just the groupings of vowels, but also the relationships *across* groupings. This allows us to use the same runes across the groupings in predictable ways that will feel intuitive to the user.

If we follow some basic principles, we can construct a chart like the following:

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   |  ᛁᛁ NEAR                    | ᛁᛡ FLEECE |           |
| ᚫ TRAP      |  ᚫᚫ PALM          | ᚫᛡ PRICE  | ᚫᚹ MOUTH  |
| ᛖ DRESS |  ᛖᛖ SQUARE                  | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT      | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT  |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT       |           | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |
| ᛟ commA |  ᛟᛟ NURSE                  |           |

Some of the lengthened phonemes do not ever occur without a ᚱ, so we could just write them as a single rune+ᚱ:

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   |  ᛁᚱ NEAR                    | ᛁᛡ FLEECE |           |
| ᚫ TRAP      |  ᚫᚫ PALM / ᚫᚱ START         | ᚫᛡ PRICE  | ᚫᚹ MOUTH  |
| ᛖ DRESS |  ᛖᚱ SQUARE                  | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT / ᚩᚱ NORTH        | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT  |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT / ᚢᚱ CURE        |           | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |
| ᛟ commA |  ᛟᚱ NURSE                  |           |

| Monophthongs | Diphthongs |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Opening      | Main       | Centering (with R or schwa) | Closing front | Closing back |
| Non-rhotic   | Rhotic     | Non-rhotic | Rhotic | Non-rhotic | Rhotic | Non-rhotic | Rhotic | Non-rhotic | Rhotic |
|              |            | ᛁ KIT | ᛁᚱ FIR | ᛁᛁ NEAR Prime | ᛁᛁᚱ NEAR (option 1) | ᛁᛡ FLEECE | ᛁᛡᚱ NEAR (option 2) |  |  |
|              |            | ᛖ DRESS | ᛖᚱ MERRY / FERN |  | ᛖᛖᚱ SQUARE (option 1) | ᛖᛡ FACE | ᛖᛡᚱ SQUARE (option 2) |  |  |
|              |            | ᚫ LAD | ᚫᚱ MARRY | ᚫᚫ BAD |  | ᚫᛡ PRICE | ᚫᛡᚱ FIRE |  |  |
|              |            | ᚪ PALM | ᚪᚱ START |  |  |  |  | ᚪᚹ MOUTH | ᚪᚹᚱ HOUR |
|              |            | ᚩ LOT | ᚩᚱ NORTH | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT | ᚩᚩᚱ FORCE (option 1) | ᚩᛡ CHOICE |  | ᚩᚹ GOAT | ᚩᚹᚱ FORCE (option 2) |
|              |            | ᛟ commA | ᛟᚱ NURSE |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ᚢ STRUT      | ᚢᚱ FUR     | ᚣ FOOT | ᚣᚱ CURE |  |  |  |  | ᚣᚹ GOOSE | ᚣᚹᚱ LURE |

I will speak more about the doubled vowels later on.

The above are the intuitive spellings for these phonemes (lexical sets). See the consistent themes? Long vowels are doubled, unless followed by an R. And glides consistently get the /j/ or /w/ applied to the "main" (short) vowel rune.

There are some shortcut/alternative runes that we may want to use like so:

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   | **ᛠᚱ NEAR**                    | **ᛇ FLEECE** |           |
| ᚫ TRAP     | **ᚪ PALM / ᚪᚱ START**           | ᚫᛡ PRICE  | ᚫᚹ MOUTH  |
| ᛖ DRESS | ᛖᚱ SQUARE                   | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT / ᚩᚱ NORTH        | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT  |
| ᚢ STRUT | **ᚣ FOOT / ᚣᚱ CURE**        |           | **ᚣᚹ GOOSE**  |
| ᛟ commA | ᛟᚱ NURSE                  |           |

These runes are not just for fun. They can help us bind together English accents. For example, there is a wide range of pronunciations for some of these phonemes. Because of that, it can be useful to have a unique rune that doesn't hint at how something is "supposed to be pronounced".

## Remove consonant doubling

Consonant doubling wasn't working. English has short vowels far more frequently than lengthened vowels and thus the doubled consonants were too frequent.

On top of that, there were so many consonants that potentially needed to be doubled, it was very inefficient.

Overall, the consonant doubling system was a holdover from previous latin spelling conventions and just didn't make sense for our needs.

## Introduce vowel doubling

Vowel doubling is done to indicate a lengthened vowel, which is fairly rare in English. 

*Vowels do not need to be doubled if they are followed by a Rad.*

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOT | ᛚᚪᛏ 🇺🇸 / ᛚᚩᛏᛏ 🇬🇧  | ᛚᚪᛏ 🇺🇸 / ᛚᚩᛏ 🇬🇧   |
| THOUGHT | ᚦᚩᛏ | ᚦᚩᚩᛏ |
| NORTH | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ 🇺🇸 / ᚾᚩᚦ 🇬🇧 | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ 🇺🇸 / ᚾᚩᚩᚦ 🇬🇧|
| SQUARE | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ 🇺🇸 / ᛋᛣᚹᛖ 🇬🇧 | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ 🇺🇸 / ᛋᛣᚹᛖᛖ 🇬🇧 |

Compare doubling (maybe) 4 vowels vs doubling 16 consonants.

## STRUT is grouped with ᚢ

While foreigners may pronounce STRUT with a PALM phoneme, the PALM phoneme has no real connection to the STRUT phoneme at all. English natives would never connect PALM to STRUT, and a spelling system should cater to what native speakers find natural.

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚣ FOOT / ᚣᚱ CURE        | ᚣᚹ GOOSE  |

Examples:

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| putt | ᛈᚪᛏᛏ | ᛈᚢᛏ |
| put | ᛈᚢᛏᛏ  | ᛈᚢᚢᛏ  |
| poot | ᛈᚢᛏ | ᛈᚣᛏ |
| pool | ᛈᚢᛚ | ᛈᚣᚹᛚ |
| pull | ᛈᚢᛚᛚ | ᛈᚣᛚ |
| boom | ᛒᚢᛗ | ᛒᚣᚹᛗ |
| bum | ᛒᚪᛗᛗ | ᛒᚢᛗ |

The user just keeps in mind that a bare ᚢ on it's own is now the STRUT phoneme. Keeping that in mind, the rest will feel intuitive based on the behaviors of all the other vowel groups.

## ᛇ for FLEECE

Previously, ᛇ was used for "rad*io*" and "g*eo*graphy" as well as the consonant sound in "lo*ch*". We are keeping the consonant sound the same. However, the vowel sound for this rune was more likely [ji(ː)] or [i(ː)j]. If it was the former, then similar to ᛡ, we will say this experienced metathesis and flipped to [i:j]. If it was the latter, then it is already FLEECE. 

## ᚣ for GOOSE

This rune visually looks like ᛁ inside of ᚢ and would thus be appropriate for any of the sounds between /i/ and /u/ on the IPA sound chart.

The ᚣ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. It's hard to find a modern day correlate to this sound. But let's look at the data:

| Sound similar to /y/ | Dialects using it for FOOT | Dialects using it for GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 0 | 4 |
| [[ʉ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 5 | 6 |
| [[ɨ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 2 | 1 |
| [[ʏ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 4 | 2 |

So out of the similar sounds, 12 dialects are using it for the GOOSE phoneme and 11 are using it for the FOOT phoneme. It's almost equal! So here are our options:

| Option | STRUT | FOOT | GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 2 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚣ | 
| 3 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 4 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚣᚹ | 

Another option entirely would be to use ᚣ as a rune that represents /ju:/ like in the word "new". The downside of this is that the "yod" is coalesced to the consonant *before* and **not** to the vowel /u:/. So if the yod is written at all, it would make more sense to be thought of as belonging with the previous consonant, not combined with /u:/.


Option 1 would be to not use ᚣ for FOOT or GOOSE at all.

Option 3 is interesting because STRUT and FOOT would then have stronger differences. The problem is that GOOSE then looks like it's more related to STRUT than to FOOT, which feels odd.

Option 4 is good because FOOT and GOOSE are so closely related. It's almost as if ᚢ lost it's way (becoming STRUT) and ᚣ brought it back home.

Option 2 is the best because GOOSE and STRUT are much more common than FOOT, so the more common sounds can get single runes. This is also the best option because STRUT and FOOT both came from the "short u" sound whereas GOOSE came from the "long u" sound. So STRUT and FOOT having one rune and GOOSE having another makes the most sense.

However, we must account for 2 mergers. The STRUT-FOOT (hull-pull) merger and the FOOT-GOOSE merger. If we go with option 4, then *visually* STRUT and FOOT look similar and *also* FOOT and GOOSE look similar. When we take into account the data above, option 4 is the best.

## happY vowel

The happY vowel is represented with a plain ᛡ now. This is because "[happy can be associated with either fleece, kit, or face, with vowel qualities in the range of /i ~ ɪ ~ e ~ ɛ/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/25-happy-lexical-set/)" and the ᛡ rune perfectly sits in that mysterious place.

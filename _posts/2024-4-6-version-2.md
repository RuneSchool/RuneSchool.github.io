Rune School is breaking away from the original spelling system and updating it based on their own experience and learnings.

A couple of things inspired this:

1. A reddit comment about how doubled vowels are attested in the futhorc corpus

2. A user complaint about the word unknown in runes: ᚪᚾᚾᚾᚩᚢᚾ

I had been playing around with my own changes to the spelling system for a long time, but I wasn't ready to show anything yet.

The goals of the spelling changes are twofold.

1. Align vowels to better match the organization [explained by Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA)

2. Drastically reduce the amount of doubling of runes

# Before and After

Here are some before and after texts to give the reader a taste of the changes.

# Changes

## Lindsey Vowels

What I call the "Lindsey Vowels" are below:

![](/assets/images/LindseyVowels.png)

You can see a similar chart in Labov's Atlas of North American English. Dr Geoff Lindsey did not invent this organization of vowels.

You can see that the overall grouping of vowels is short vowels (red), "linking r" or lengthened vowels (yellow), and glide vowels (sea green).

Based on this grouping, I have created my own to suit our needs a bit better.

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolVowelChart.png)

You can see that I have tried to show a bit more cleanly not just the groupings of vowels, but also the relationships *across* groupings. This allows us to use the same runes across the groupings in predictable ways that will feel intuitive to the user.

If we follow some basic principles, we can construct a chart like the following:

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   |  ᛁᛁ NEAR                    | ᛁᛡ FLEECE |           |
| ᚫ TRAP      |  ᚫᚫ PALM          | ᚫᛡ PRICE  | ᚫᚹ MOUTH  |
| ᛖ DRESS |  ᛖᛖ SQUARE                  | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT      | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT  |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT       |           | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |
| ᛟ commA |  ᛟᛟ NURSE                  |           |

Some of the lengthened phonemes do not ever occur without a ᚱ, so we could just write them as a single rune+ᚱ:

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   |  ᛁᚱ NEAR                    | ᛁᛡ FLEECE |           |
| ᚫ TRAP      |  ᚫᚫ PALM / ᚫᚱ START         | ᚫᛡ PRICE  | ᚫᚹ MOUTH  |
| ᛖ DRESS |  ᛖᚱ SQUARE                  | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT / ᚩᚱ NORTH        | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT / ᚩᚹᚱ FORCE  |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT / ᚢᚱ CURE        |           | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |
| ᛟ commA |  ᛟᚱ NURSE                  |           |

I will speak more about the doubled vowels later on.

The above are the intuitive spellings for these phonemes (lexical sets). See the consistent themes? Long vowels are doubled, unless followed by an R. And glides consistently get the /j/ or /w/ applied to the "main" (short) vowel rune.

There are some shortcut/alternative runes that we may want to use like so:

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /j/ Glide | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ᛁ KIT   | **ᛠᚱ NEAR**                    | **ᛇ FLEECE** |           |
| ᚫ TRAP     | **ᚪ PALM / ᚪᚱ START**           | ᚫᛡ PRICE  | **ᚣ MOUTH**  |
| ᛖ DRESS | ᛖᚱ SQUARE                   | ᛖᛡ FACE   |           |
| ᚩ LOT   | ᚩᚩ THOUGHT / ᚩᚱ NORTH        | ᚩᛡ CHOICE | ᚩᚹ GOAT / ᚩᚹᚱ FORCE  |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT / ᚢᚱ CURE        |           | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |
| ᛟ commA | ᛟᚱ NURSE                  |           |

These runes are not just for fun. They can help us bind together English accents. For example, there is a wide range of pronunciations for some of these phonemes. Because of that, it can be useful to have a unique rune that doesn't hint at how something is "supposed to be pronounced".

## Remove consonant doubling

Consonant doubling wasn't working. English has short vowels far more frequently than lengthened vowels and thus the doubled consonants were too frequent.

On top of that, there were so many consonants that potentially needed to be doubled, it was very inefficient.

Overall, the consonant doubling system was a holdover from previous latin spelling conventions and just didn't make sense for our needs.

## Introduce vowel doubling

Vowel doubling is done to indicate a lengthened vowel, which is fairly rare in English. 

*Vowels do not need to be doubled if they are followed by a Rad.*

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOT | ᛚᚪᛏ 🇺🇸 / ᛚᚩᛏᛏ 🇬🇧  | ᛚᚪᛏ 🇺🇸 / ᛚᚩᛏ 🇬🇧   |
| THOUGHT | ᚦᚩᛏ | ᚦᚩᚩᛏ |
| NORTH | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ 🇺🇸 / ᚾᚩᚦ 🇬🇧 | ᚾᚩᚱᚦ 🇺🇸 / ᚾᚩᚩᚦ 🇬🇧|
| SQUARE | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ 🇺🇸 / ᛋᛣᚹᛖ 🇬🇧 | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ 🇺🇸 / ᛋᛣᚹᛖᛖ 🇬🇧 |

Compare doubling (maybe) 4 vowels vs doubling 16 consonants.

## STRUT is grouped with ᚢ

While foreigners may pronounce STRUT with a PALM phoneme, the PALM phoneme has no real connection to the STRUT phoneme at all. English natives would never connect PALM to STRUT, and a spelling system should cater to what native speakers find natural.

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚢᚢ FOOT / ᚢᚱ CURE        | ᚢᚹ GOOSE  |

Examples:

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| putt | ᛈᚪᛏᛏ | ᛈᚢᛏ |
| put | ᛈᚢᛏᛏ  | ᛈᚢᚢᛏ  |
| poot | ᛈᚢᛏ | ᛈᚢᚹᛏ |
| pool | ᛈᚢᛚ | ᛈᚢᚹᛚ |
| pull | ᛈᚢᛚᛚ | ᛈᚢᚢᛚ |
| boom | ᛒᚢᛗ | ᛒᚢᚹᛗ |
| bum | ᛒᚪᛗᛗ | ᛒᚢᛗ |

The user just keeps in mind that a bare ᚢ on it's own is now the STRUT phoneme. Keeping that in mind, the rest will feel intuitive based on the behaviors of all the other vowel groups.

## ᛇ for FLEECE

Previously, ᛇ was used for "rad*io*" and "g*eo*graphy" as well as the consonant sound in "lo*ch*". We are keeping the consonant sound the same. However, the vowel sound for this rune was more likely [ji(ː)] or [i(ː)j]. If it was the former, then similar to ᛡ, we will say this experienced metathesis and flipped to [i:j]. If it was the latter, then it is already FLEECE. 

## Misc

Short and highly common words may drop the final glides. For example, "to" may be spelled as just ᛏᚢ instead of ᛏᚢᚹ. Think of how contractions like "gotta", "gonna", "finna", "hafta" sort of end in a STRUT.

The happY vowel is represented with a plain ᛡ now. This is because "[happy can be associated with either fleece, kit, or face, with vowel qualities in the range of /i ~ ɪ ~ e ~ ɛ/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/25-happy-lexical-set/)" and the ᛡ rune perfectly sits in that mysterious place.

## TODO 

The ᚣ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. This sounds is only present in [some dialects today for the word "few"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence). Because of this, this rune could be an optional way to spell words like "new", "few", "dune", etc. Although it may make more sense to simply spell these words as ᛄᚢ. I would like to revisit this rune's applicability to the MOUTH phoneme, though.

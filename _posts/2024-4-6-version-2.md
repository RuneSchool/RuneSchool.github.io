Rune School is breaking away from the original spelling system and updating it based on their own experience and learnings.

A couple of things inspired this:

1. A reddit comment about how doubled vowels are attested in the futhorc corpus

2. A user complaint about the word unknown in runes: ᚪᚾᚾᚾᚩᚢᚾ

I had been playing around with my own changes to the spelling system for a long time, but I wasn't ready to show anything yet.

The goals of the spelling changes are twofold.

1. Align vowels to better match the organization [explained by Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA)

2. Drastically reduce the amount of doubling of runes

# Before and After

Here are some before and after texts to give the reader a taste of the changes.

# Changes

## Lindsey Vowels

What I call the "Lindsey Vowels" are below:

![](/assets/images/LindseyVowels.png)

You can see a similar chart in Labov's Atlas of North American English. Dr Geoff Lindsey did not invent this organization of vowels.

You can see that the overall grouping of vowels is "lax checked" or short (red), "linking r" or lengthened vowels (yellow), and closing diphthong (sea green).

Based on his chart, I have created my own chart to suit our needs a bit better.

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolVowelChart.png)

You can see that I have tried to show a bit more cleanly not just the groupings of vowels, but also the relationships *across* groupings. This allows us to use the same runes across the groupings in predictable ways that will feel intuitive to the user.

If we follow some basic principles, we can construct a chart like the following:

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolLexicalSets.png)

I will speak more about the doubled vowels later on.

The above are the intuitive spellings for these phonemes (lexical sets). See the consistent themes?

Now to simplify this system further, we can remove vowel doubling where it is not necessary and use different runes instead of some doubled vowels.

These runes are not just for fun. They can help us bind together English accents. For example, there is a wide range of pronunciations for some of these phonemes. Because of that, it can be useful to have a unique rune that doesn't hint at how something is "supposed to be pronounced".

Here is a much simpler list with only the most popular lexical sets:

## Remove consonant doubling

Consonant doubling wasn't working. English has short vowels far more frequently than lengthened vowels and thus the doubled consonants were too frequent.

On top of that, there were so many consonants that potentially needed to be doubled (16), it was very inefficient.

Overall, the consonant doubling system was a holdover from previous latin spelling conventions and just didn't make sense for our needs.

## Introduce vowel doubling

Vowel doubling is done to indicate a lengthened vowel, which is fairly rare in English. 

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOT | ᛚᚪᛏ 🇺🇸 / ᛚᚩᛏᛏ 🇬🇧  | ᛚᚪᛏ 🇺🇸 / ᛚᚩᛏ 🇬🇧 |
| THOUGHT | ᚦᚩᛏ | ᚦᚩᚩᛏ |
| SQUARE | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᚱ | ᛋᛣᚹᛖᛖᚱ |
| NURSE | ᚾᛟᚱᛋ | ᚾᛟᛟᚱᛋ |

## ᚢ for STRUT

While foreigners may pronounce STRUT with a PALM phoneme, the PALM phoneme has no real connection to the STRUT phoneme at all. English natives would never connect PALM to STRUT, and a spelling system should cater to what native speakers find natural.

| Main    | Lengthened (often with R) | /w/ Glide |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| ᚢ STRUT | ᚣ FOOT / ᚣᚱ CURE        | ᚣᚹ GOOSE  |

Examples:

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| putt | ᛈᚪᛏᛏ | ᛈᚢᛏ |
| put | ᛈᚢᛏᛏ  | ᛈᚣᛏ  |
| pool | ᛈᚢᛚ | ᛈᚣᚹᛚ |
| pull | ᛈᚢᛚᛚ | ᛈᚣᛚ |
| boom | ᛒᚢᛗ | ᛒᚣᚹᛗ |
| bum | ᛒᚪᛗᛗ | ᛒᚢᛗ |

## ᛇ for FLEECE

Previously, ᛇ was used for "rad*io*" and "g*eo*graphy" as well as the consonant sound in "lo*ch*". We are keeping the consonant sound the same. However, the vowel sound for this rune was more likely [ji(ː)] or [i(ː)j]. If it was the former, then similar to ᛡ, we will say this experienced metathesis and flipped to [i:j]. If it was the latter, then it is already FLEECE. 

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| radio | ᚱᛖᛡᛞᛇ | ᚱᛖᛡᛞᛡᚩᚹ |
| geography | ᚷᛇᚸᚱᛟᚠᛁ | ᚷᛡᚩᚸᚱᛟᚠᛡ |
| fleece | ᚠᛚᛁᛋ | ᚠᛚᛇᛋ |

## ᚣ

This rune visually looks like ᛁ inside of ᚢ and would thus be appropriate for any of the sounds between /i/ and /u/ on the IPA sound chart.

The ᚣ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. It's hard to find a modern day correlate to this sound. But let's look at the data:

| Sound similar to /y/ | Dialects using it for FOOT | Dialects using it for GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 0 | 4 |
| [[ʉ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 5 | 6 |
| [[ɨ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 2 | 1 |
| [[ʏ]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 4 | 2 |

So out of the similar sounds, 12 dialects are using it for the GOOSE phoneme and 11 are using it for the FOOT phoneme. It's almost equal! So here are our options:

| Option | STRUT | FOOT | GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 2 | ᚢ | ᚢᚢ | ᚣ | 
| 3 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚢᚹ | 
| 4 | ᚢ | ᚣ | ᚣᚹ | 

Another option entirely would be to use ᚣ as a rune that represents /ju:/ like in the word "new". The downside of this is that the "yod" is coalesced to the consonant *before* and **not** to the vowel /u:/. So if the yod is written at all, it would make more sense to be thought of as belonging with the previous consonant, not combined with /u:/.

Option 4 is good because of the STRUT-FOOT (hull-pull) merger and the FOOT-GOOSE merger. *Visually* STRUT and FOOT look similar and *also* FOOT and GOOSE look similar. So FOOT is the meeting point of the two. Also, STRUT is a more open sound than FOOT on the IPA vowel chart and ᚢ looks more visually open than ᚣ.

## happY vowel

The happY vowel is represented with a plain ᛡ now. This is because "[happy can be associated with either fleece, kit, or face, with vowel qualities in the range of /i ~ ɪ ~ e ~ ɛ/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/25-happy-lexical-set/)" and the ᛡ rune perfectly sits in that mysterious place.

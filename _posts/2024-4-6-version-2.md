Rune School is [branching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_%28version_control%29) off from the (excellent) [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online/) spelling system and updating it based on their own experience and learnings.

# Why

A couple of things inspired this:

1. A reddit comment about how doubled vowels are attested in the futhorc corpus

2. A user complaint about the word unknown in runes: ᚪᚾᚾᚾᚩᚢᚾ

I had been playing around with my own changes to the spelling system for a long time, but I wasn't ready to show anything yet.

The goals of the spelling changes are twofold.

1. Align vowels to better match the organization [explained by Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA)

2. Drastically reduce the amount of doubling of runes

So much is owed to [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online/) and it is not this author's desire to break away and never return. That is why I consider these changes a "branch". The changes are really not so significant and it is my desire to continue working together and maybe [merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_%28version_control%29) together again in the future.

# Before and After

Here are some before and after texts to give the reader a taste of the changes.

## Lindsey Vowels

What I call the "Lindsey Vowels" are below:

![](/assets/images/LindseyVowels.png)

You can see a similar chart in Labov's Atlas of North American English. Dr Geoff Lindsey did not invent this organization of vowels.

You can see that the overall grouping of vowels is "lax checked" or short (red), "linking r" or lengthened vowels (yellow), and closing diphthong (sea green).

Based on his chart, I have created my own chart to suit our needs a bit better.

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolVowelChart.png)

You can see that I have tried to show a bit more cleanly not just the groupings of vowels, but also the relationships *across* groupings. This allows us to use the same runes across the groupings in predictable ways that will feel intuitive to the user.

We can get more mileage from fewer letters by using this system. It'll also feel like less work by having predictable patterns across and within categories.

<!--If we follow some basic principles, we can construct a chart like the following:

I will speak more about the doubled vowels later on.

The above are the intuitive spellings for these phonemes (lexical sets). See the consistent themes?

Now to simplify this system further, we can remove vowel doubling where it is not necessary and use different runes instead of some doubled vowels.

These runes are not just for fun. They can help us bind together English accents. For example, there is a wide range of pronunciations for some of these phonemes. Because of that, it can be useful to have a unique rune that doesn't hint at how something is "supposed to be pronounced".

Here is a much simpler list with only the most popular lexical sets:

## Remove consonant doubling

Consonant doubling was not working for me. English has short vowels far more frequently than lengthened vowels and thus the doubled consonants were too frequent.

On top of that, there were so many consonants that potentially needed to be doubled (16), it was very inefficient.

Overall, the consonant doubling system was a holdover from previous latin spelling conventions and just didn't make sense for our needs.

## Introduce vowel doubling

Vowel doubling should be done to indicate a lengthened vowel, which is fairly rare in English. 

Vowel doubling is about as equally attested in Runes as consonant doubling.

See further posts for how these changes can be manifested.

Rune School is [branching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_%28version_control%29) off from the (excellent) [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online/) spelling system and updating it based on their own experience and learnings.

# Why

A couple of things inspired this:

1. A reddit comment about how doubled vowels are attested in the futhorc corpus

2. A user complaint about the word unknown in runes: ·ö™·öæ·öæ·öæ·ö©·ö¢·öæ

I had been playing around with my own changes to the spelling system for a long time, but I wasn't ready to show anything yet.

The goals of the spelling changes are twofold.

1. Align vowels to better match the organization [explained by Dr Geoff Lindsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA)

2. Drastically reduce the amount of doubling of runes

So much is owed to [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online/) and it is not this author's desire to break away and never return. That is why I consider these changes a "branch". The changes are really not so significant and it is my desire to continue working together and maybe [merge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_%28version_control%29) together again in the future.

# Before and After

Here are some before and after texts to give the reader a taste of the changes.

# Changes

## Lindsey Vowels

What I call the "Lindsey Vowels" are below:

![](/assets/images/LindseyVowels.png)

You can see a similar chart in Labov's Atlas of North American English. Dr Geoff Lindsey did not invent this organization of vowels.

You can see that the overall grouping of vowels is "lax checked" or short (red), "linking r" or lengthened vowels (yellow), and closing diphthong (sea green).

Based on his chart, I have created my own chart to suit our needs a bit better.

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolVowelChart.png)

You can see that I have tried to show a bit more cleanly not just the groupings of vowels, but also the relationships *across* groupings. This allows us to use the same runes across the groupings in predictable ways that will feel intuitive to the user.

If we follow some basic principles, we can construct a chart like the following:

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolLexicalSets.png)

I will speak more about the doubled vowels later on.

The above are the intuitive spellings for these phonemes (lexical sets). See the consistent themes?

Now to simplify this system further, we can remove vowel doubling where it is not necessary and use different runes instead of some doubled vowels.

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolLexicalSets-Reduced.png)

These runes are not just for fun. They can help us bind together English accents. For example, there is a wide range of pronunciations for some of these phonemes. Because of that, it can be useful to have a unique rune that doesn't hint at how something is "supposed to be pronounced".

Here is a much simpler list with only the most popular lexical sets:

![](/assets/images/RuneSchoolLexicalSets-Simplified.png)

## Remove consonant doubling

Consonant doubling wasn't working. English has short vowels far more frequently than lengthened vowels and thus the doubled consonants were too frequent.

On top of that, there were so many consonants that potentially needed to be doubled (16), it was very inefficient.

Overall, the consonant doubling system was a holdover from previous latin spelling conventions and just didn't make sense for our needs.

## Introduce vowel doubling

Vowel doubling is done to indicate a lengthened vowel, which is fairly rare in English. 

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOT | ·õö·ö™·õè üá∫üá∏ / ·õö·ö©·õè·õè üá¨üáß  | ·õö·ö™·õè üá∫üá∏ / ·õö·ö©·õè üá¨üáß |
| THOUGHT | ·ö¶·ö©·õè | ·ö¶·ö©·ö©·õè |
| SQUARE | ·õã·õ£·öπ·õñ·ö± | ·õã·õ£·öπ·õñ·õñ·ö± |
| NURSE | ·öæ·õü·ö±·õã | ·öæ·õü·õü·ö±·õã |

## ·õü·õü·ö± for NURSE

Previously, the system used ·õü·ö± for both lettER and NURSE. As an American, I am totally fine with this. But I know that many English speakers have a strong distinction between these two phonemes. 

Based on the principles shown at the top of this page, it only makes sense to allow for a doubled ·õü·õü. This brings our system more aligned to the phonemic distinctions that Shavian allows.

Think of it this way:

> Merry ·õñ·ö± is to SQUARE ·õñ·õñ·ö± as lettER ·õü·ö± is to NURSE ·õü·õü·ö±

## ·ö¢ for STRUT

While foreigners may pronounce STRUT with a PALM phoneme, the PALM phoneme has no historical connection to the STRUT phoneme at all. Because of this English natives would never connect PALM to STRUT in their minds. A spelling system should cater to what native speakers find natural, not foreign learners.

STRUT originally came from the "short u" sound. Because of this, it's appropriate to think that if runes had continued in use, people would have eventually started to pronounce ·ö¢ as a STRUT.

Examples:

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| putt | ·õà·ö™·õè·õè | ·õà·ö¢·õè |
| put | ·õà·ö¢·õè·õè  | ·õà·ö£·õè  |
| pool | ·õà·ö¢·õö | ·õà·ö£·öπ·õö |
| pull | ·õà·ö¢·õö·õö | ·õà·ö£·õö |
| boom | ·õí·ö¢·õó | ·õí·ö£·öπ·õó |
| bum | ·õí·ö™·õó·õó | ·õí·ö¢·õó |

For more info on FOOT ·ö£, see below.

## ·ö¢·öπ for GOAT

It's no secret that GOAT can have a wide range of starting points. But when we consider the possible range of pronunciations for STRUT 

![possible pronunciations for STRUT](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/1860/2022/05/STRUT_Lexical_Set_2.png)

and the possible range of starting points for GOAT, 

![possible pronunciations for GOAT](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/1860/2022/05/GOAT_Lexical_Set_2.png)

they are a very good match.

It's true that when GOAT is monophthongized, it tends to be closer to the THOUGHT vowel. Consider though that many pronunciations of ·ö¢ (STRUT) are just unrounded versions of THOUGHT. So it's not a difficult stretch to say that ·ö¢ + ·öπ together would make such a sound. The lips round during the off-glide anyway.

There are also some pronunciations of GOAT that involve a FOOT or GOOSE sound. ·ö¢ being the cousin of ·ö£ makes perfect sense for this (more on ·ö£ below).

The hull-hole merger feels right at home with this orthography as well. 

·ö¢ is just the best middle-ground between the RP style schwa (·õü for us) starting point and the GA style ·ö©.

·ö©·öπ will remain a valid orthography for the GOAL lexical set; for when people want to be exact. People may choose to write names with this phoneme, for example. But for the most part, we will recommend that GOAL is subsumed into the GOAT set with ·ö¢·öπ.

·ö¢ also just so happens to not have a lot going on in this system, so this makes the rune a bit more commonplace.

## ·ö£ for FOOT

This rune visually looks like ·õÅ inside of ·ö¢ and would thus be appropriate for any of the sounds between /i/ and /u/ on the IPA sound chart.

The ·ö£ rune most likely had a /y:/ sound. It's hard to find a modern day correlate to this sound. But let's look at the data:

| Sound similar to /y/ | Dialects using it for FOOT | Dialects using it for GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[y]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 0 | 4 |
| [[ â]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 5 | 6 |
| [[…®]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_central_unrounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 2 | 1 |
| [[ è]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_rounded_vowel#Occurrence) | 4 | 2 |

So out of the similar sounds, 12 dialects are using it for the GOOSE phoneme and 11 are using it for the FOOT phoneme. It's almost equal! So here are our options:

| Option | STRUT | FOOT | GOOSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ·ö¢ | ·ö¢·ö¢ | ·ö¢·öπ | 
| 2 | ·ö¢ | ·ö¢·ö¢ | ·ö£ | 
| 3 | ·ö¢ | ·ö£ | ·ö¢·öπ | 
| 4 | ·ö¢ | ·ö£ | ·ö£·öπ | 

Another option entirely would be to use ·ö£ as a rune that represents /ju:/ like in the word "new". The downside of this is that the "yod" is coalesced to the consonant *before* and **not** to the vowel /u:/. So if the yod is written at all, it would make more sense to be thought of as belonging with the previous consonant, not combined with /u:/.

Option 4 is the best because of the STRUT-FOOT (hull-pull) merger and the FOOT-GOOSE merger. *Visually* STRUT and FOOT look similar and *also* FOOT and GOOSE look similar. So FOOT is the meeting point of the two. Also, STRUT is a more open sound than FOOT on the IPA vowel chart and ·ö¢ looks more visually open than ·ö£.

## ·õá for FLEECE

Previously, ·õá was used for "rad*io*" and "g*eo*graphy" as well as the consonant sound in "lo*ch*". We are keeping the consonant sound the same. However, the vowel sound for this rune was more likely [ji(Àê)] or [i(Àê)j]. We are representing the FLEECE phoneme as /ij/ and as such, this is the perfect shortcut rune for that sound.

| Latin | Runes BEFORE | Runes NOW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| radio | ·ö±·õñ·õ°·õû·õá | ·ö±·õñ·õÑ·õû·õ°·ö©·öπ |
| geography | ·ö∑·õá·ö∏·ö±·õü·ö†·õÅ | ·ö∑·õ°·ö©·ö∏·ö±·õü·ö†·õ° |
| fleece | ·ö†·õö·õÅ·õã | ·ö†·õö·õá·õã |

Users may represent FLEECE as either ·õÅ·õÑ or ·õá.

## ·õ° for happY vowel

"[happY can be associated with either fleece, kit, or face, with vowel qualities in the range of /i ~ …™ ~ e ~ …õ/](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/lexicalsets/chapter/25-happy-lexical-set/)". KIT, FLEECE, and happY are not three distinct sounds. Rather, happY could be either KIT or FLEECE. If anyone has used Shavian before, you know the pain of not having a letter just for this happY phoneme.

Previously, the ·õÅ rune represented both KIT and FLEECE and therefore if it was on the end of a word, it could be whatever you wanted it to be. The one issue that would occur from this is the famous confusion of "candied" and "candide".

Now, we have different runes for both KIT and FLEECE. So the happY vowel is now represented with ·õ°. 

·õÑ and ·õ° are famously controversial. Many believe that they are two different styles for the same rune. But the fact is that multiple manuscripts contain both of these runes and they even have different names. That would not be the case if they were just stylistic variants of the same rune.

·õ° was called "ƒ™or", meaning "eel". ·õÑ was called "Gƒìr", meaning "year". 

If we take each of these runes sounds as being the first phoneme of their names, then ·õ° has an /i/-ish sound and ·õÑ has a /j/-ish sound.

The /i/-ish sound is perfect for the happY vowel. And moving ·õÑ to the FACE, PRICE, and CHOICE phonemes will make it consistent with the usage of ·öπ in this same regard.

| Candide (2) | ·õ£·ö´·öæ·õû·õÅ·õû      | ·õ£·ö´·öæ·õû·õá·õû   |

Ultimately, if a user confuses these two runes and uses just one for happY and /j/, it's not the end of the world. But offering this distinction should aid in clarity.

# Font Update

You may notice that the *look* of Rune School has changed. This is because we have swapped the primary font to [Catrinity](https://catrinity-font.de/)!

Catrinity [recently updated to version 2.09](https://catrinity-font.de/versions.html) which adds a host of new bindrunes, among other things. Now instead of writing "Ohio" like ᚩᚹᚻᚫᛡᚩᚹ we can write it like ᚩ‍ᚹᚻᚫ‍ᛡᚩ‍ᚹ. And since we have a bind for ᛋᚳ, it will be more clear that we are writing "pasture" (ᛈᚫᛋᚳᛟᚱ) instead of something like "passion" (ᛈᚫᛋ‍ᚳᛟᚾ).

# New Dictionary

Rune School offers a [dictionary](https://rune.school/dictionary) that should help new learners with the spelling standard. There is also a naive [auto-translation](https://rune.school/dictionary/translate) tool at your disposal.

# Word Game

If you're looking for more immersion in runic spelling, see the new daily [word game](https://rune.school/game)! All of the instructions are even in runes. 

The word game uses the new dictionary, and thus also uses the spelling standard. But it does not use some shortcut runes in order to make the game slightly easier.

- ᚪ -> ᚫᚫ
- ᛇ -> ᛁᛡ
- ᛠ -> ᛁᛁ
- ᛥ -> ᛋᛏ
- ᛢ -> ᛣᚹ

There is a channel on the [Rune School discord server](https://discord.gg/BThW4fxAwN) where you can post your daily results and compare with others.

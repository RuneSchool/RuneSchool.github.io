Some updates on rune school: 

- new dictionary
- new wordle-like game (but donâ€™t call it that or the NYTimes will legit demand that I take it down. They have done this before)
- working with a linguistics person to ensure that the system is usable / adaptable for all English accents
- Catrinity font updated with a bunch of bindrunes that we can use

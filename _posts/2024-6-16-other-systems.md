description: A comparison between 4 different ways of writing modern English with Anglo-Saxon Futhorc runes
hidden: false
---

In this blog, I am going to compare 5 different systems for writing Modern English with the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. The goal for doing so is to increase collaboration and communication across these projects and increase the possiblity of working together in the future.

1. [Younger Futhorc](https://anglisc.miraheze.org/wiki/Younger_Futhorc)
2. [American Futharch](https://americanfutharch.com/)
3. [Futhorc.com](http://futhorc.com/about.htm)
4. [Rune Revival](https://runerevival.online/)
5. Rune School (here)

**Note**: American Futharch and Futhorc.com end up using runes from outside the standard Futhorc corpus

# Sample Texts



# Consonants

For the most part, the consonants are all the same in these systems. The only differences are with **z**oo, vi**s**ion, **y**od, 

| sound | Younger Futhorc | American Futharch | Futhorc.com | Rune Revival | Rune School |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /f/ | ᚠ | ᚠ | ᚠ | ᚠ | ᚠ |

| /θ/ | ᚦ | ᚦ | ᚦ | ᚦ | ᚦ |
| /ð/ | ᚦ | ᛨ | ᚧ | ᚦ | ᚦ |
| /r/ | ᚱ | ᚱ | ᚱ | ᚱ | ᚱ |
| /tʃ/ | ᚳ | ᚳ | ᛏᚳ | ᚳ | ᚳ |
| /j/ | ᚷ ᛡ | ᛄ | ᛃ |  | ᛡ |
| /x/ | ᛇ |  |  | ᛇ | ᚻ |
| /w/ | ᚹ | ᚹ | ᚹ | ᚹ | ᚹ |
| /h/ | ᚻ | ᚻ | ᚻ | ᚻ | ᚻ |
| /n/ | ᚾ | ᚾ | ᚾ | ᚾ | ᚾ |
| /p/ | ᛈ | ᛈ | ᛈ | ᛈ | ᛈ |
| /ks~gz/ | ᛉ | ᚴᛋ | ᚴᛋ | ᛣᛋ | ᛣᛋ |
| /s/ | ᛋ | ᛋ | ᛋ | ᛋ | ᛋ |
| /z/ | ᛋ | ᛉ | ᛋ | ᛉ | ᛉ |
| /t/ | ᛏ | ᛏ | ᛏ | ᛏ | ᛏ |
| /b/ | ᛒ | ᛒ | ᛒ | ᛒ | ᛒ |
| /m/ | ᛗ | ᛗ | ᛗ | ᛗ | ᛗ |
| /l/ | ᛚ | ᛚ | ᛚ | ᛚ | ᛚ |
| /ŋ/ | ᛝ | ᛝ | ᛝ | ᛝ | ᛝ |
| /ŋg/ | ᛝ | ᛝᚷ | ᛝᚸ | ᛝ | ᛝᚸ |
| /d/ | ᛞ | ᛞ | ᛞ | ᛞ | ᛞ |
| /k/ | ᛣ | ᚴ | ᚴ | ᛣ | ᛣ |
| /g/ | ᚸ | ᚷ | ᚸ | ᚸ | ᚸ |
| /dʒ/ | ᚳᚷ | ᛥ | ᛞᛄ | ᚷ | ᚷ |
| /ʒ/ | ᚳᚷ | ᛯ | ᛄ | ᛉᚳ | ᛉᚳ |
| /ʃ/ | ᛋᚳ | ᛊ | ᚳ | ᛋᚳ | ᛋᚳ |
| /ʍ/ | ᚻᚹ |  |  | ᚻᚹ | ᚻᚹ |

So let's take a closer look at some of these differences. 

The Younger Futhorc stuck with ᚷ for the /j/ (yod) sound. This would perhaps be the most authentic choice.

# Vowels

Predictably, the vowels are where things tend to vary the most between these systems.

Now let's look at how the vowel runes land on the IPA vowel chart for a stronger visual comparison.

# Thoughts

Now just comparing sound assignments doesn't fully explain the reasons *why* the creators of these systems made the choices they did. Each sound assignment has ripple effects that will change the sound assignments for other runes.

In order to really compare these choices, we need to talk about the underlying values and philosophy. For example, are we going for authenticity? Are we going for clarity of design?

I would say that American Futharch aims to be more opinionated, as a work of art. Younger Futhorc and Rune Revival aim to be more authentic. Futhorc.com and Rune School seem to aim for authenticity while also wanting something more systematic.

My primary goals for a good modern rune system would be:

1. Authenticity to the original Futhorc
2. Usable for all English accents
3. Systematically satisfying

Regarding authenticity, I like one principle that Rune Revival adheres to. They are willing to draw from the Elder Futhark, but they won't draw from any traditions later than the Anglo Futhorc. I find that to be an authentic comporomise when thinking outside the box is needed. Another aspect of authenticity is the most common runes still being the most common in a modern system (if possible). 
# Compromise

Now what would a compromise between all of these systems look like?

The authenticity of the Younger Futhorc but with an added element of a more robust... system? 

Let's try something as a way to start the conversation:

After using and teaching the Rune School system, I can say that it really does feel *intuitive*, simple, and functional. This is because time was spent thinking about how to phonologically analyze English as a complete system. 

What I am looking for in improvements to the Rune School system:

1. Being more functional for people with different accents (mergers of phonemes, for example)
2. More authentic to the original Futhorc

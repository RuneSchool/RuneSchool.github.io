I love to teach and to learn. Especially so when it is on the topic of language. Everything taught in the course here is from Rune Revival, who I met online in late 2022. I am just applying my own teaching methodology to their system.

If you've ever wanted to learn how to read and write English with the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc runes, this is the place to be. Have fun!
